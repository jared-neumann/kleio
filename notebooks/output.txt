The OCR output appears to be quite poor, with many errors. Based on the context provided and assuming British English from the publication date, here are some suggested corrections:

### Corrections:
1. ) should be (
2. • should be :
3. . should be . or , depending on context
4. l should be the letter L
5. K should be C or S, depending on context
6. » should be > or >>, depending on context
7. < should be <
8. \ should be \ or /, depending on context
9. I should be i or I, depending on context
10. ' should be ' or ' ', depending on context
11. t should be the letter t
12. i should be the letter i

### Corrected Text:
( 
: . 
L 
> 
< 
\ /
i ti
I I
t t
i i
)

### Comments:
It's important to note that without additional context, some of these corrections may not be entirely accurate. For example, the context of "K" could be "C" for century or "S" for square root. Similarly, the context of "I" could be capitalized depending on whether it begins a new sentence or not. It's always important to double-check your work and consider the context when making corrections to OCR output.PREFACE.

Having completed our First Volume, we would be remiss if we did not express our gratitude to the Public at large for the favourable reception our labours have received; and to those Scientific Gentlemen in particular who have provided us with Communications, as well as suggestions for the future improvement of this work.

The grand Object of it is to disseminate Philosophical Knowledge among all classes of society, and to provide the Public as early an account as possible of everything new or curious in the scientific world, both at home and on the continent. We flatter ourselves with the hope that the liberal patronage we have thus far experienced will be continued; and that Scientific Men will afford us the support and encouragement which they may deem our endeavours deserve. Whatever successes we may achieve in future, no efforts shall be spared on our part to render this Work useful to Society, and particularly to the Arts and Manufactures of Great Britain, which, as is well known, have been greatly improved by the great progress that has recently been made in various branches of Philosophical Sciences.

### Comments:
This response preserves the original text's style and tone while correcting OCR errors. The corrected text uses standard English spelling and grammar, ensuring clarity for modern readers. The comments section is used to provide additional context and explanation for any significant changes made during the correction process.
It appears that some characters in the OCR output are incorrect or missing due to poor image quality or other issues with the OCR process. Based on the provided context and information, I will do my best to correct the errors below while maintaining the original meaning of the text as closely as possible.

#### Corrections:
1. Replace 'W*- -• • x' with 'With': This appears to be a contraction for "with" that was incorrectly interpreted by the OCR software.
2. Replace 'M ' with 'Mr.' or 'Mr.'s, depending on the context. In this snippet, it seems more likely that it is an abbreviation for 'Mister'.
3. Replace '/ /' with '/': This appears to be a simple error in the OCR output where the forward slash was incorrectly recognized as two separate slashes.
4. Add missing periods at the end of sentences. Since this is a British English text from 1798, the period may be represented as a full stop.
5. Replace 'I ' with 'In': This appears to be an instance where the OCR software misunderstood the character 'I' for the word "in."
6. Replace 'V-l4.•- ' with 'Vol. XIV.' or 'Volume XIV.', depending on the context. In this snippet, it seems more likely that it is a volume number for an academic journal.
7. Replace 'l ' with 'the'. This appears to be a missing article before the word "volume."
8. Correct the spacing between the words 'V' and '.' to ensure proper reading order.
9. Add missing quotes around 'y' or replace it with the correct word, depending on the context. In this snippet, it seems more likely that it is a quotation mark that was incorrectly recognized as a letter.
10. Replace ''\ ' with '\': This appears to be an error where the backslash was incorrectly recognized as two separate backslashes.

#### Corrected Snippet:
> Mr With
> In Volume XIV.
> I In
> V .
> The
> Mr V's
> y
> /
> '\ '
> .1
> .

### Comments:
It is important to remember that OCR corrections should be made with care and consideration for the context of the text. In some cases, incorrect characters may not significantly impact the meaning of a sentence or phrase, while in others they could completely change it. Additionally, it's crucial to maintain the original tone and style of the text as much as possible during corrections.
