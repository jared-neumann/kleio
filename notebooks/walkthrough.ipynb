Account of Mr, Cartwright's Patent Steam Engine* \\nHP \\n-l HE fleam engiri'e is confidered, and with juftice, as the \\nfirft mechanical invention of modern times. The parent \\nidea of this new and ftupendous power originated, it is well \\nknown, in the fertile mind of the Marquis of Worcefler, in \\nthe time of the Charles’s * though Captain Savary feems to \\nhave been the firft who actually pointed out to the public its \\npractical application. In his hands, however, it was but \\nHercules in the cradle. Newcomen and his aflbciate have \\nthe merit of bringing it to maturity, and giving to its energies \\na valuable direction. The principal improvements that have \\nbeen added to it for the laft thirty years, it has received from \\nthe hand of the juftly celebrated Mr. Watt. From the \\nmany fruitlefs attempts which have been made lince the date \\nof Mr. Watt’s patent. Hill further to improve the fleam \\nengine, the public has been led to believe, either that it has \\nalready arrived at its highefl flate of perfection, or that its \\ndefeats admitted not of remedy. Thefe defeCts, as every \\none knows, are an imperfeCt vacuum, much friCtion, and a \\nComplicated conftruCtion of parts; liable, without great care \\nand attention, to be frequently out of order. It is to thefe \\npoints Mr. Cartwright has immediately, and, we may add, \\nfuccefsfully, directed his attention. His firft objeCt feems \\nto have been to obtain, as nearly as may be, an abfolute \\nVqi, I, B -vacuum $ \\n\", '% Mr. Cartwright’s Patent Steam Engine. \\nvacuum; which, in confequence of the elaflic vapour that \\nfeparates from water injected in the ufual mode of conden- \\nfation, no one in the leafl converfant with the philofophy of \\nthe fleam engine need be told is impoffible. The con¬ \\ndensation, in Mr. Cartwright’s engine, is performed by the \\napplication of cold to the external furface of the veffel con¬ \\ntaining the Ream. Mr. Cartwright is not, however, the \\nfirft who tried this method; the fame has been attempted by. \\nfeveral; but with fo little fuccefs, that one of our firfl \\nengineers in this line has been heard to give it as his opinion, \\nthat, were a pipe to be laid acrofs the Thames, the condenfa- \\ntion would not be quick enough to work a fleam engine \\nwith its full effect. The manner Mr. Cart-wright manages \\nthis bufinefs is by admitting the fleam between two metal \\ncylinders lying one within the other, and having cold water \\nflowing through the inner one, and enclofing the outer one. \\nBy thefe means a very thin body of fleam is expofed to the \\ngreatefl poffible furface. But this is not all: by means of a \\nvalve in the piflon there is a conflant communication at all \\ntimes between the condenfer and the cylinder, either above \\nor below the piflon, fo that, whether it afcends or defcends, \\nthe condenfation is always taking place. \\nTo reduce the fridtion of the piflon, which, when frefh \\npacked in the common way, lays a very heavy load upon the \\nengine, Mr. Cartwright makes his folely of metal, and ex- \\npanfive. There is a further advantage in this method, from the \\nfaving of time and expence in the packing, and from the piflon \\nfitting more accurately, if poffible, the more it is worked. \\nMr. Cartwright has been equally attentive in fimplifying \\nall the other parts of the engine; his engine having only \\ntwo valves, and thofe are as nearly felf-acting as may be. \\nBut what will probably be efleemed one of the mofl im¬ \\nportant circumflances attending thefe improvements, is the \\nopportunity they afford of fubflituting ardent fpirit, either \\nwholly or in part, in the place of water, for working the \\nengine.. For, as the fluid with which it is worked is made to \\n* .-r circulate \\n', \"Mr, Cartwright's Patent Steam ’Engine, 3 \\ncirculate through the engine without mixture or diminution, \\nthe ufing alcohol, after the firft fupply, can be attended with \\nlittle or no expence. O11 the contrary, the advantage will be \\ngreat, probably equal to the faving of half the fuel. When, \\nindeed, the engine is applied, as Mr. Cartwright occafionally \\npurpofes, both as a mechanical power and as a Hill at the \\nfame time, the whole fuel will be faved. \\nA farther advantage of this invention is its applicability \\nto purpofes requiring only a fmall power, and for wThich any \\nother engine would be too complicated and expeniive. \\nPlate I. reprefents a feCtion of the different parts of the \\nengine. A is the cylinder, which is fupplied with fleam from \\nthe boiler through the pipe a, B the pifton, in the aCt of \\ngoing up. I the pipe which conducts the fleam into C the \\ncondenfer, being a double cylinder, between which the fleam \\nis condenfed, and from thence paffes through h into the pump \\nD. The pifton D when going down preffes the condenfed \\nwater upon the valve c and {huts it, by which means the \\nwater is forced to find a paflage through d into the air box E. \\nWhat air or elaftic vapour may have been driven along writh \\nthe water into E rifes to the upper part of the box, where \\naCting by its elafticity on the furface of the water, the latter, \\n{hutting the valve h, is forced through the tube^ and by this \\nmeans returned into the boiler. When the air is collected \\nin fiich quantity as to force the float g to fink to a certain \\ndepth, the valve e opens, and allows a portion of it to efcape. \\nF the fleam valve is opened by the return of the pifton B, \\nwhich raifes the rod attached to the under fide of F, while \\nat the fame time the valve G is {but by its rod being prefled \\nagainft the top of the cylinder. When the pifton B, prefled \\ndown by the fleam introduced from the tube a through the \\nvalve F, reaches the bottom of the cylinder, the valve G is \\nopened • by its rod touching the bottom, while at the fame \\ninftant the fpring 1 fhuts the fleam valve F. \\nHH two cranks, upon whofe axes are two equal wheels \\nworking ia each other for the purpofe of giving a rectilinear \\nB % direction \\n\", \"4.

The Genuine Oriental Procefsfor giving to Cotton Yarn or \\nStuff' the fafl or ingrained Colour, biown hy the Name of\\nTurkey Red, as praStifed at AJlracan. From Neue Nor- \\ndifche Beytrage, hy Profcjfor Pallas, \\ni \\n\\\\ \\nMETHOD of giving a fixed red to cotton yam, f3 \\nmuch fought after by the Europeans in the prefent century, \\nis now known in England, and practifed in the fouthern \\nparts of France; but, as It is not univerfally known, and as \\nthefe proceftes are not only different, perhaps, from the \\noriental method, but, like the one for dyeing cotton with \\nmadder defcribed by Hellot, far inferior to that pra&ifed by \\nthe Armenians at Aftracan, the prefent information may not \\nbe fuperfluous. \\nProfeftor OettingCr at Tubingen made, long ago, in a \\nfmall publication which appeared in 1764, adifcovery which \\n•plight have led to the fecret of the oriental procefs for dyeing \\nwith madder. He there remarked that the beautiful dye of\\nthe' Turkifti yarn, which withftands the ftrongeft folvents, \\nbecomes immediately diffolved by common olive oil, in fuch \\na manner that the colour may be transferred from a thread \\nof Turkey yarn to any other undyed thread. Hence it \\nclearly appears, that either the dye itfelf, or the preparing \\nliquor (appret), or both, muft be of a fat nature, and foluble \\nin oil: and an ingenious artift might have built with ad-,\\nvantage on thefe grounds, as will be fufftciently feen by the \\nfollowing defcription of the oriental procefs employed to dye \\nwith madder, which I here give exadlly as it was related to \\nme* \\n\", \"/■ Oriental Procefs for dyeing Red, 5 \\nand I (hall leave the improvement of it to thofe t« \\nwhofe department it belongs, and who have a tafte for \\ntechnical chemiftry. \\nThe greater part of the filk and cotton manufactories at \\nAftracan are carried on by Armenians, the number of whom \\non account of the troublefome ftate of Perfta is continually \\nincrealing; and the dye-houfes are kept going only from the \\nfirft warm days in the fpring till towards the end of autumn. \\nThe madder they employ comes partly by land over Kitzlar \\nfrom Terek, and partly by fea over Derbent from the Perfian \\nGhilan. In both places the plant grows wild in the fields in \\ngreat abundance and great perfection, and is dug up alfo in \\nthe uncultivated meads. The roots are generally as thick as \\nthe barrel of a quill, fometimes as one's finger, and through¬ \\nout the whole fpongy part of an agreeable pale red colour: \\nthe bark on the other hand is for the mo ft part very thin, and \\nappears to be of little value. At Terek the frefh gathered \\nroots are placed above each other in a ftove, or in a pit dug \\nin vifcous earth which has been ftrongly heated. Earth is \\nthen thrown over the madder, and it muft fweat until the \\nftove or pit becomes cold; when the roots, the fecond or \\nthird day, are taken from it, and either fpread out or hung \\n*tp to dry. The fame procefs is ufual alfo in Perfta, and \\nabundance of madder is brought from the remote parts of that \\ncountry to Ruffia, At Aftracan it is fold, according to the im¬ \\nportation, at from four to feven rubles for every forty pounds. \\nThis madder is ground at Aftracan, for the ufe of the \\ndyers, in horfe-mills kept by the common people, and con- \\nftruCted in the following manner: In the middle of the \\nmill, which is built on a level fpot of ground, a circular place \\nis walled round with bricks to the height of four fpans, the \\ninner face of which is made to Hope gently from the cir¬ \\ncumference towards the centre, and a groove goes round the \\njnfide of this brick-work to receive the mill-ftone. The \\nwhole furface of the brick-work is covered with plane \\nftnooth boards, and in the middle of it ftands a perpendicular \\nB 3 fpindle. \\n\", '6 Oriental Procefs for dyeing jtied, \\nfpindle, which at the top is inferted in a crofs beam, and at \\nthe bottom refts in a focket. The fpindle is turned by \\nmeans of an oblique beam palling through it, to the fhorter \\nend of which is fattened a mill-ftone moveable like a wheel \\nround its axis, and a horfe is yoked to the other end, which \\nreaches beyond the brick-work. The madder, which has \\nbeen well dried in the fun, muft be firft coarfely broken in \\nthe groove under the mill-ftone, and afterwards ground until \\nit become a very fine powder. \\nIn tfte fame mills are ground the round leaves of the \\nfumach (rbus cotinus), which gives a yellow dye, and which \\nis brought to Aftracan from the neighbourhood of Terek, \\nwhere it grows wild under the Tartarian name balga, or, as \\nthe Armenians exprefs it, beige, and is employed fometimes \\nin dyeing with madder, fometimes in dyeing dark yellow, and \\nfometimes in the preparation of Turkey leather. Thefe \\nleaves, when whole, have a pleafant green colour; but when \\nbruifed they exhibit that yellow dye with which they are im¬ \\npregnated, and which is produced alfo by the woody part \\nand branches: but as thefe are not fo eafily cleaned, they are \\ncarefully feparated from the ground duft of the leaves by \\nmeans of a fieve. A pud or forty pounds of thefe leaves, in \\nthe ftate in which they, are brought to Aftracan, cofts five, \\nfix, and often feven and a half rubles. \\nThe dye-ftuffs neceftary for dyeing red, befides the two \\nalready mentioned, are gall-nuts, alum, an indigenous bad \\nkind of foda, called kalalzar, which is burnt in the wilds of \\nKifiar and Aftracan, from the falfuginous or foda plants, that \\ngrow there in abundance, and laftly fifti-oil. The latter is \\nboiled in the fiflieries on the lower part of the Volga, and on \\nthe Cafpian fea, frona the entrails of the lturgeon and other \\nlarge fifti, but chiefly from thofe of the perca lucioperca, the \\nftiad, and other kinds little efteemed in thofe parts. The \\nproof of its being proper for dyeing is, that when mixed writh \\na lixivium of foda it muft immediately afiTume a milky ap¬ \\npearance. Should that not be the cafe, it cannot be ufed by \\nthe \\n', 'Oriental Procejs for dyeing Red. 7 \\nthe dyers. The foda is burnt partly at Kiflar by Armenians, \\nand partly in the wilds of Aftracan by the Calmucks. The \\nlatter, becaufe it is very impure, fells at Aftracan for only fif¬ \\nteen copeks per pud, but the former is worth more than thirty. \\nThe cotton to be dyed red is firft waflied exceedingly clean \\nin running water, and, when the weather is clear, hung up \\non poles to dry. If it does not dry before the evening, it is \\ntaken into the houfe, on account of the faline dews fo re¬ \\nmarkable in the country around Aftracan, and again expoled \\nto the air next morning. When it i3 thoroughly dry it is \\nlaid in a tub, and fifh-oil is poured over it till it is entirely \\ncovered. In this ftate it muft ftand all night, but in the \\nmorning it is hung up on poles, and left there the whole \\nday; and this procefs is repeated for a week, fo that the cot¬ \\nton lies feven nights in oil, and is expofed feven days to the \\natmofphere, that it may imbibe the oil and free itfelf from \\nfell air. The yarn is then again carried to a ft ream, cleaned \\nas much as poftible, and hung up on poles to dry. \\nAfter this preparation a mordant is made of three mate¬ \\nrials, which muft give the grounds of the red colour. The \\npulverifed leaves of the fumach are firft boiled in copper \\nkettles; and when their colouring matter has been fufficiently \\nextracted fome powdered galls are added, with which the \\nliquor muft be again boiled; and by thefe means it acquires a \\ndark dirty colour. After it has been fufficiently boiled the \\nfire is taken from under the kettle, and alum put into \\nthe ftill hot liquor, where it is foon diffolved. The propor¬ \\ntion of thefe three ingredients I cannot determine with fuf- \\nficient accuracy, becaufe the dyers make ufe of different \\nquantities at pleafure. The powder of the fumach leaves is \\nmeafured into the kettle with ladles; the water is poured \\nin according to a gauge, on which marks are made to fhew \\nhow high the water muft ftand in the kettle to foak fix, \\neight, ten, &c. puds of cotton yarn. The galls and alum \\nare added in the quantity of five pounds to each pud of cot- \\n13 4 ton* \\n', \"$ Oriental Procefs for dyeing Red. \\nton. In a word, the whole mordant mull be fufficiently \\nyellow, flrong, and of an aftringent tafte. \\nAs feon as the alum is diffolved, no time mud be loll in \\norder that the mordant may not be fuffered to cool. The \\nyarn is then put into hollow blocks of wood fhaped like a \\nmortar, into each of which fuch a quantity of the mordant \\nhas been poured as may be fufficient to moiften the yarn \\nwithout any of it being left. As foon as the workman \\nthrows the mordant into the mortar, he puts a quantity of \\nthe yarn into it, and preffes it down with his hand till it be¬ \\ncomes uniformly moiltened, and the whole cotton yarn has \\nilruck. By this it acquires only a pale yellow colour, which \\nhowever is durable. It is then hung up on poles in the fun \\nto dry; again walhed in the llream, and afterwards dried \\nonce more. \\nBy the yellow dye of the fumach leaves, the madder dye \\nbecomes brighter and more agreeable; but the galls damp the \\nfuperfluous yellow, and together with the alum prepare the \\nyarn for its colour. Some dyers however omit the ufe of \\nthefe leaves altogether, and prepare their mordant from galls \\nand alum only, by firft boiling the galls in due proportion \\nwith the requifite quantity of water, then dilfolving the alum \\nwith boiling water in a feparate veffel, afterwards pouring \\nboth liquors together into a tub, and fuffering the cotton to \\nremain in them an hour, or an hour and a half; after which \\nit is dried gradually, then wafhed, and again dried once \\nmore. By this procefs the yarn acquires a dirty reddifh \\ncolour. \\nThe next part of the procefs is to prepare the madder dye. \\nThe madder, 'ground to a fine powder, is fpread out in large \\ntroughs, and into each trough is poured a large cup full of \\nfheep's blood, which is the kind that can be procured with \\nthe greateft facility by the dyers. The madder muft be \\nflrongly mixed in it by means of the hand, and then hand \\nfome hours in order to be thoroughly foaked by it. The lt- \\nquojf \\n\", '0 rie nlcd Procefs for dyeing Red. \\n#pior then afifumes a dark red appearance, and the maddey \\nin boiling yields more dye. \\nAfter this procefs water is made hot in large kettles, fixed \\nin brick-work $ and as foon as it is warm the prepared red \\ndye is put into it, in the proportion of a pound to every \\npound of cotton. The dye is then fuffered to boil flrongly $ \\nand when it is enough, which may be tried on cotton threads, \\nthe fire is removed from under the kettle, and the prepared \\ncotton is depofited near it. The dyer places himfelf on the \\nedge of the brick-work that encloles the kettle j dips the cot¬ \\nton yarn, piece by piece, into the dye; turns it round, back¬ \\nwards and forwards; preffes it a little with his hands ; and \\nlays each piece, one after the other, in pails Handing ready \\nfor the purpofe. As foon as all the cotton has received the \\nfirft tint, it is hung up to dry: as the red, however, is Hill \\ntoo dull, the yarn which has been already dyed once, and be¬ \\ncome dry, is put once more into the dyeing-kettle, and muft \\nbe left there to feethe for three hours over a Hrong fire, by \\nwhich it acquires that beautiful dark red colour which is fo \\nmuch efieemed in the Turkey yarn. The yarn is now taken, \\nfrom the dye with Hicks ; the fuperfluous dye which adheres \\nto it is fhaken off 3 the hanks are put in order, and hung up, \\none after another, to dry. When it is thoroughly dry, it is \\nwaflied in the pure Hream and again dried. The only fault \\nof the Afiracan dyers is, that the colour is fometimes brighter \\nO \\nand fometimes darker, probably becaufe they do not pay fuf- \\nficient attention to the proportions, or becaufe the madder is \\nnot always of the famegoodnefs. \\nIn the laH place, the abovementioned foda (kalakar) is dif- \\nfolved with boiling water in tubs deftined for that purpofe, \\nand it is ulual here to allow twenty pounds of foda to forty \\npounds of cotton, or half the weight. Large earthen jar&, \\nwhich are made in Perfia of very Hrong clay, a yard and a \\nhalf in height, almofi five fpans wide in the belly, and end¬ \\ning in a neck a fpan and a half in diameter, enclofed by \\n?neans of cement in brick-work over a fire-place, in fuch a \\nmanner \\n', 'IO \\nOriental Procefs for dyeing Red. \\nmanner that the necks only appear, are filled with the dyed \\ncotton yam. The ley of diflolved foda, which is blackifh and \\nvery {harp, is then poured over it till the jars be filled j and \\nfome clean rags are prefled into their mouths, that the up- \\npermoft fkains of yarn may not lie uncovered. A fire is then \\nmade in the fire-place below, and continued for twenty-four \\nhours ; and in the mean time the fleam wThich arifes from \\nthe jars is feen collected among the rags in red drops. By \\nthis boiling the dye is ftill more heightened, and is made to \\nflrike completely; every thing fuperfluous is removed, and all \\nthe fat matter which ftill adheres to the yam is wraflied out: \\nnothing more is then neceflary for completing the dye of the \\nyarn but to rinfe it well feveral times in running water, and \\nthen to dry it. \\nThat the dye of madder might be made very penetrating \\nby other methods, and through the means of other oily and \\nrefinous fubftances, is {hewn by the procefs of theTungufians \\nto dye horfe’, goat’s and rein-deer’s hair, which they ufe for \\nornamenting their dreffes, of a beautiful red colour, by the \\nroots of the crofs-wort, or northern madder (gallium), and \\nnarrow-leaved woodroof (afferula tin&oria), which have a \\nrefemblance to thofe of madder. They boil the frefh or dried \\nroots with about the fame quantity of agaric (agaricus offi- \\ncinarum), which, as is well known, is abundant in refinous \\ngummy particles, and is ufed by the people of Jakut inftead \\nof foap; they then lay in it the white hair which they wifh \\nto dye, and fuffer it to feethe flowly until it be fufliciently \\nred. \\nCotton cloth is dyed with madder at Aftracan in the fame \\nmanner : but many purfue a fraudulent procefs, by dyeing \\nwith red wood, and then fell their cloth as that which has \\nbeen dyed in the proper manner. \\nNote by the Editor, \\nOne circumflance in the preceding procefs deferves parti¬ \\ncular attention, as it furnifhes a hint which, if properly fol¬ \\nlowed \\n', \"Method to purify Lead for A faying. 2 x \\nlowed up, may perhaps enable our dyers to give to cotton \\nall, or at lead a number of the colours which at prefent can \\nonly be communicated to woollen.

Method of 'purifying Lead from Gold and Silver, fo as to \\nmale it fit for the Purpofe of Affaying. By Pet. Jac. \\nHjelm. From the New Tranfa&ions of the Royal Aca¬ \\ndemy of Sciences at Stockholm. \\nOn many occafions, particularly in trying the finenefs of \\ngold, it is neceflary to employ lead free from the mixture of \\nany other metal. For fuch experiments, above all, one mud \\nnot make ufe of lead which already contains gold or Silver, \\nor both thefe metals, without knowing the quantity, which, \\nat all times, occafions difficulty and often uncertainty. In \\nits natural date lead, for the mod part, is found fo mixed \\nwith \\n\", 'I \\njZ Method to purify Leadfor AJ/aying. \\nwith thefe noble metals, that after being fmelted it cannot \\nbe employed for the above purpofe; and though there br \\nlead ore which exhibits only a very few or no traces of their \\nprefence, and in the firft cafe the proportion mull never be \\njnorethana quarter of a grain in the pound [mark), it ie \\n‘exceedingly rare in the common courfe of mining to find \\npieces of fuch a nature, and people often have not leifure to \\nfearch for them. As I have fometimes been expofed to \\ngreat inconvenience for want of a proper piece of lead, I \\nendeavoured to find out an eafy method of procuring, with¬ \\nout a tedious procefs, fuch a quantity of pure lead as would \\nbe fufficient for the before-mentioned teft; and as I do not \\nremember to have heard of its being any where defcribed or \\nemployed, I have reafon to think that an account of it may \\nbe of fome ufe, at leaf!: in the art of allaying, in cafe a more \\nextenfive application of fuch a fmelting procefs be not pol- \\nlible on a large fcale, or if it fhould not be found profitable. \\nWhen one begins to reflect on ^his object, the firft idea that \\noccurs is to accomplifii the end in view, by diflolving the \\nlead in an acid, and then precipitating either the lead or the \\nfiner metals ; but on clofcr examination there is no procefs \\nof this kind which will not be either too expenlive, when it \\nis neceflary to prepare feveral pounds at once, or require \\nlonger time than one can poftibly bellow, For thefe reafons \\nI gave up this method, and adhered to that only which was \\nperformed merely by fufing in a crucible with the afliftanc^ \\nof a requifite degree of heat, \\nEirjl Experiment, \\nLitharge, a cheap article that can be eafily procured, was \\nthe firft fubftance with which I thought it neceflary to make \\nexperiments. As it fecmed poffiblethat it might be free from \\nany mixture of filver, that circumftance was firft examined \\nbefore I proceeded further. [ then melted fome ounces of \\nlitharge wjth equal quantities of pot-afh and tartar ; but th<? \\nlead obtained from this mixture contained ftill about half a \\ngrai1* \\n', 'jS/dethod to purify Lead for Ajfayinfo j * \\n^tain in the pound. It was therefore of no ufe for proofs by \\nioorification and for allaying; and the principal point now \\nwas to free the litharge from its mixture. This objcfit I \\naccompliflicd by a few meltings, in the following manner : \\nI placed a crucible, in which half a pound of litharge \\nfound good room, and which was fitted with a clofe cover, \\nin a wind-furnace filled with dead coals. I then put into \\nthe crucible a mixture of four ounces of potafli and the \\nfame quantity of powder of flint. When the whole was \\nwell melted by hlengthening the draught and making the \\ncoals glow, I took off the cover, and laid hold of the cruci¬ \\nble with a pair of tongs, in order to take it out, and to dif¬ \\nfer this very fufible giafs to cover the infide of the crucible* \\nto feeure it from the giafs of the lead which I meant to \\nmelt m it. I he fuperfluous glals was poured out j the \\ncrucible again placed on its foot, and half a pound of li¬ \\ntharge thrown into it with a (hovel. The cover was placed \\nupon it while the litharge was melting; and when it waj \\nthoroughly glowing and fluid, charcoal duff was lifted into \\nthe uncovered crucible through a fieve, fo that the furface \\nof the litharge was completely covered with it. This im¬ \\nmediately produced an effervefcence, and the riling of bub¬ \\nbles, by means of the feparation of the air occafioned by \\nthe redu&ion of the lead. During this proeefs the cove? \\nwas put on and a few coals thrown into the furnace : when \\nthefe were burnt every thing in the crucible was quiet, and \\nthe melted mafs was poured into a warm conical mould* \\nIhe crucible was then again filled with half a pound of \\nthe fame kind of litharge, and put into the furnace, and \\ncharcoal duff was feveral times fifted over the melted fur- \\nface, till it was well covered before the mafs was thrown \\nout, a fufficient fpace being every time left for the effervef¬ \\ncence. The firft mafs had, in the mean time, become cool, \\nand, on examination, contained four ounces of lead at the \\nbottom, and litharge at the top. When this litharge was \\nreduced with potafli and crude tartar, the lead thence ob¬ \\ntained* \\n', '14 Method to purify Lead for Affaying. \\ntained, which weighed 23 ounces, was found to contain lefs \\nthan ~ grain of filver in the pound. In the fecond mafs \\nthere was found fomewhat more than fix ounces of lead, \\nwhich contained all the filver that had been before mixed \\nwith the litharge, becaufe in the lead which had been re¬ \\nduced from the litharge in the above manner there were \\nno perceptible traces of filver. This lead was then melted \\nover a How fire, and cafi into bars, which were rolled fmooth \\nand formed into maffes of a known weight, to be ufed for \\nallaying gold and filver, and for other purpofes of the fame, \\nkind. All thefe meltings were made in one crucible, which, \\naccording to every appearance, remained unhurt. If the \\nfame experiments were made with red lead, the like refult \\nwould infallibly follow. \\nThe caufe of this procefs, and of the effects thence pro-* \\nduced, is, that when lead, which contains a fmall quantity of \\nfilver, is calcined and brought into the Hate of litharge, the \\nfilver in it, if not fcorified, is diffufed in infinitely fine par¬ \\nticles, fo that it is impoffible for it to fink through the melted \\nlitharge and fettle at the bottom. When the lead calx is \\nrevived on the furface, the leaden grains, as they are formed, \\nfink down through the litharge, and carry with them the \\nfcattered grains of filver, in fo far as this leaden fhower, if \\nI may fo name it, is compadf and powerful enough to col¬ \\nled! them. Were the opinion of thofe jufi, who allert that \\na calx of lead free from filver, when revived by tartar, ac¬ \\nquires again, by the creation of new filver, a portion of that, \\nmetal, litharge ought not to be revived by tartar, or any \\nthing of the like kind from the vegetable kingdom; but on \\nthis occafion I found no fuch effedt produced. \\nSecond Experiment, \\nWith the fame view of obtaining lead free from filver, I \\nmelted, in the like manner, half a pound of white lead, \\nwhich produced half an ounce of lead. When the litharge \\nHanding over it was revived, the lead obtained was Hill \\nfound \\n', \"/ \\nMethod to purify Lead for Affaying. 14 \\nfound to contain too much filver. I therefore precipitated' \\nanother half pound of white lead by charcoal powder, after \\nthe lead thaf'fell from it had been feparated; and then it \\nproduced, by reviving, a mafs of lead without any mixture \\nof filver. \\nThird Experime?it. \\nCupels, employed for refining filver, imbibe about the \\nhalf of their weight of lead calx. One might therefore be¬ \\nlieve, that when this lead calx is revived it would produce \\nlead free from filver. Befides the obfervadon of others, \\nwhich confirms the contrary, I have made experiments with \\nthe allies of fuch cupels in which allaying had been per¬ \\nformed with the utmoft accuracy; but I found that the lead \\nthence made into ingots contained fometimes more than one \\nquarter of a grain of filver in the pound. The bone afhes, \\nfrom which cupels are generally caft, are, by themfelves, \\nalmoft infufible; and this, on account of the great number of \\nfluxes which muff be employed to bring them to a fluid ftate, \\nmakes the fufion of them difficult and expenfive. To four \\nparts of fine pounded cupel allies, I put four parts of \\npotafh, four parts of fait, three parts of tartar, and one part \\nof clay, which mixed together produced, after being melted, \\npart of lead, making almoft 44 parts in the hundred \\nBut this ftiil contained the above-mentioned quantity of \\nfilver, and could not therefore be proper for the propofed \\nend. \\n% \\nAs the two flrft-mentioned experiments will completely \\nanfwer the purpofe, it is perhaps unneceftary to feek for \\nother methods; as it will be hardly poffible to find any lefs \\ncomplex, or eafier to be put in practice. \\n* There mud here be an error in the original. Xnftead of i|part of \\nlead, we ought, perhaps, to read if. \\nIV. On \\n\", 'f t« J \\ntv. Oil the Irregularity in the Rate of Going of Time-pieces \\naccajionedhy the Influence of Magnet fm. An original Coni* \\nmunication, by Mr. VaRLET. \\nHaVING ftudied the theory of clock and watch-making \\nmany years, as well as been, part of that time, concerned \\nin an extcnfive manufactory of watches, I have had many \\nopportunities of obferving a circumftance which has fur- \\nprifed every one in the trade as well as rnyfelf; that watches \\nof confiderable price, and from the hands of excellent work¬ \\nmen, often perform no better than a plain one of inferior \\nworkmanfhip and much lower price. Being anxious, as may \\nnaturally be fuppofed, to furnifh my friends with watches or \\nclocks which would go well, I made it my bufinefs to pay \\nparticular attention to whatever could contribute to their \\nperfeCfion. With this view, I made almoft numbcrlefs ex¬ \\nperiments and obfervations on the various efcapements now \\nin ufe, the different conftruCtions of balances, pendulums, \\npendulum fprings and compenfations, both for clocks and \\nwatches, which have been applied by very ingenious me¬ \\nchanics and excellent workmen to correct the errors in the \\nrate of going, efpecially of watches, occafioned by the va¬ \\nrious degrees of heat and cold, change of pofition, external \\nagitation, influence of oil, friction, variation of maintaining \\npower, and other caul.es. \\nSome of thefe contrivances are extremely well adapted to \\nanfwer the intended purpofe; but, notwithflanding all their \\nadvantages, the maker and purchafer are frequently difap- \\npointed in the performance of the machine to which they \\nare applied. Many inffanc.es might be produced where the \\nbeft workmen have been employed, no expence [pared by \\nthe maker, and the above-mentioned improvements applied \\nwith the utmofl care and attention; and yet the rate of \\ngoing of the watch has been more irregular than in ford a \\nordinary watches.

It happened that I was then fitting \\nwith my face to the fouth : a eircumftanee that led me, in- \\nplacing the plane of the balance vertically, to put it north \\nand fouth, and of courfe the axis eafl and well —the only \\nportion in which the magnetic influence could make itfelf \\nmoft apparent, and which will account for the eircumftanee/ \\nnot having been observed by the workman who examined \\nthe poife of the balance before I did, • for, as often as I \\nplaced the plane of the balance vertically between eafl; and \\nwell it was in poife, whichever end of its axis was placed \\ntowards the fouth^ \\nHaving \\n\", '.* t . - * f \\nJLiffeEl of Magnetifm on Time-pieces. 1 q \\nHaving pretty well fatisfied myfelf as to the caufe, I now \\nproceeded to determine the poles of the balance. With that \\nView I placed its axis in a vertical fituation, ahd of coiirfe its \\nplane was horizontal; and I was much furprifed to find that, \\nin that pofition, it pbffeffed fufficient polarity to overcome \\nthe fribtion upon its pivot; fdr it readily turned on its axis \\nto place its north pole towards the north. Making a mark \\non that fide that I might know its north pole^ I then re¬ \\npeatedly turned that point towards the fouth; and, when left \\nat liberty, it as often refumed its former pofition, performing \\na few vibrations before it quite fettled itfelf in its fituation \\nand came to reft— ‘exactly as a needle would do if fufpended \\nin the fame manner. \\nI was extremely happy that I had obferved thefe effebls \\nbefore I brought a inagtiet to make the experiment I firft in¬ \\ntended, as I might, and as others alfo might have concluded, \\nthat the polarity had been produced by the approach of the \\nmagnet. I now, however brought a magnet into the {hop, \\nand, prefenting its fouth pole to the marked fide, that is, to \\nthe north pole of the balance, the balance continued at reft: \\nbut upon prefenting the north pole to the marked place, it \\nimmediately receded from the magnet, and refumed its for¬ \\nmer pofition whenever the magnet was withdrawn. \\nNo doubt now remaining as to the fabts, and being in \\npoffefiion of the pofition of its poles, I proceeded to examine \\nthe effects produced by this caufe upon the watch’s rate of \\ngoing. Having put on the pendulum fpring, and replaced \\nthe balance in the watch, I laid the watch with the dial \\nupwards, that is, with the plane of the balance horizontally^ \\nand in fuch a pofition that the balance when at its place of reft \\nfiiould have its marked fide toward the north;—in this fitua¬ \\ntion it gained f in twenty-four hours. I then changed \\nits pofition fo that the marked fide of the balance when at reft \\nfhouid be towards the fouth, and, obferving its rate of going \\nfor the next twenty-four hours, found it had loft 6\\' 48\\'\\'\\'—• \\nproducing, by its change of pofition only, a difference of \\nC 2 \" 12\\' \\n', \"£0 Effect of Magnetlfm on Time-pieces. \\ntzr 2$f/ in its rate.

This circumffance, taken along with the amount of \\nthe variation occafioncd by the polarity of the balance, was \\nfully fufficient to produce all the irregularity obferved in the \\ngoing of the Watch. \\nI then took away the Heel balance, fubliituted one made \\nof gold, and, having brought the watch to time, obferved its \\nrate of going, and found it as uniform as any watch of the \\nlike conftruftion; for, though it was a duplex efcapement, \\nwhich is perhaps the belt yet invented, at lead for common \\npurpofes, it had no compenfation for the expanfion and cqn- \\nt raft ion oceaiioned by heat and cold, and therefore a perfeft. \\nperformance was not expefted. \\nSteel balances being commonly in ufe, and, on that ac¬ \\ncount, eafieft to be procured, and being on many accounts \\npreferable to any other, I was unwilling to abandon them \\nentirely; but rcfolved to take the precaution of always trying \\nthem before I fhould apply them to ufe.

It was Paid to be the beft, as it \\nexceeded in whitenefs the Sardinian and Corfican; and the \\npeafon of this probably lay in its being better purified; for \\nthe Africans, as Pliny tells us, were accuftomed to ufe alkali \\nin order to render this fubflance whiter, and, in my opinion, \\nto free it from all greafy matter. It was then called Punic \\nwax, as Venetian turpentine, foap, and wax, are now pre- \\nferibed in books of receipts in qrder to fignify the bell;; and \\nwe muft conclude, if, inftead of confidering the wax to \\nhave been merely bleached, we convert it into real foap, \\n' arifmg from the clofe combination of the wax with the alkali, \\nthat we change and pervert the meaning of thefe authors. \\nThe idea which I formed of the period of en-cauflic painting, \\nand the country where invented, was eonfiderably different, \\nand I have had the pleafure of finding it afterwards con¬ \\nfirmed by experiments and fa&s. \\nThe knowledge and life of encauffic painting is certainly \\nolder than the time qf the Greeks and the Romans, to whom \\nthe learned Requeno feems to affign the exclufive poffeffion \\npf this art; becaufe the Egyptians, who with the Etrufcans \\nwere the parents pf the greater part pf the inventions known \\namong mankind, and from whom the Greeks learned f© \\nmuch, were acquainted with ,and employed encauftip paint¬ \\ning in the ancient ages of their greatnefs and fplendour, as is \\nproved by the valuable fragments of the bandages and \\ncoverings \\n\", 'On Encauftk Tainting, 2 ^ \\ncoverings of a mummy painted in this manner, which, hy \\nthe favour of our gracious prince, the noble patron and pro¬ \\nmoter of the arts and feienees, is expo-led to the view of \\nevery connoiffeur, in his elegant mufeum.

But \\nX will not here enter intq a panegyric of the Egyptians, who \\naccompliflicd fo great things, and much earlier than the \\n(jiccks or the Romans; it will be fuffiejent to have (hewn, as \\na point unknown in the hi (lory of the arts, that thefe people \\npra&hed cncauflic painting, as appears beyond a doubt from \\nthe before-mentioned fragment : but I will confefs that this \\nwould be a barren knowledge if it did not lead us to other \\nufeful refearcjies. I muff obferve, in the firft place, that no \\noil-painting, perhaps of only two or three hundred years old, \\nexhibits a white paint that has kept Xb well as that feen on \\nthe abo\\\\ c fragment; and this eircumftance fufliciently proven \\nthe \\n', \"Oft JZncauJlic Vainihig* \\nthe valuable advantage that method has over the comm® \\noil-painting, which, notwithstanding the general opinion, \\ncannot have been unknown to the ancients ; for, befides olive- \\noil, they were acquainted with that of fefaraom, turpentine, \\ncedar, and nut oils. It is impofiible that in Egypt and Phoe¬ \\nnicia, where lb much ufe was made of flax, the oil pro¬ \\ncured in abundance from that plant fhotild have been un¬ \\nknown. Thofe who have kept oil, or who have fpilt any \\nof it, whether nut or lintfced oil, mull have remarked that \\nit pofteffes the property of foon drying by the effects of the \\natmofphere; and therefore it may be eafily believed that \\nmankind mu ft; foon have conceived the idea of employing \\nit, particularly, for fhips, which, as Herodotus fays, were \\npainted with red ochre in the earlicft periods, and adorned \\nwith- figures and ornaments. The ufe of oil afforded paint¬ \\ning a much fimpler and eafier method. than that of wax : it \\nxnuft therefore have been firft adopted, and the tranfition \\nfrom oil to wax inuft be confidered as' a flep towards bring¬ \\ning the art to pertedfion ; becaufe encatiftie painting is not \\nexpofed to the irremediable mconvemencies that arile in oil- \\npainting, the value of which we extolled through ignorance, \\nand praiied as a new invention. \\nOil in general, and in particular drying oil which the \\npainters ufe, has naturally a ftrong inclination to combine \\nitfelf with the vital air or oxygen of the atmofphere, and by \\njmbibiny oxyyen it becomes dry, and a fiumes the character \\nof refin; hut the colour then becomes darker, as is the cafe \\nwith transparent turpentine, which gradually becomes a black \\npitch.. \\nAccording to the pew and more accurate method of de- \\npompofing bodies, oil confifts principally of hydrogen and \\ncarbon. By coming into contact with the atmofphere, and \\nabsorbing its oxygen and light, it undergoes a flow and im¬ \\nperceptible conibuftion, which is not cffentially different \\nfrom the fpeedy and violent which it would undergo in thq \\n.common mode of burning. It firft palles^ by imbibing oxy- \\ngen. \\n\", \"f)n Ihncavjlic Pamilng. \\ngen, into the (late of a more or lefs dark refill; lofes gra¬ \\ndually its effential hydrogen, which makes a new combina-? \\n4ion, and afterwards the oxygen itfelf which has attracted \\nthe carbon ; and at length leaves behind a thin layer of acn \\ntual carbon, which in the end becomes black in the courfo \\nof time, and confider^bly obfcures the oil-painting. By a \\ncontinuance of the before-mentioned flow combufiion the \\ncarbon itfelf, as it were, burns alfo : if it be ftrongly acted \\nupon by the light, it attracts the oxygen of the atmofphere, \\nand again brings forward the carbonic acid or fixed air, which \\ngradually flies off. By this, which I may call the fecond \\ndegree of combuftion, the pointing rnufi: become dufly and \\nfriable, like crayon painting (il pajlello) • a phenomenon \\nwhich may be clearly perceived on oil-paintings, which are \\ngenerally covered with wood and iron-work, that they may \\nthe better withftand the atmofphere. \\nThe allies, oxydes, or calces of metals, which are often \\npfed as paints, are nothing elfe than metals actually brought \\nto a burnt or faline ftate by different doles of oxvsfen. When \\nthe oil, during the time of the before-mentioned combuftion, \\ndeprives thein of fome part of their oxygen by means of its \\nwell-known affinity, the metal again proportionally aflumes \\nits natural ftate and colour; and as the calces or allies of \\nthe iron, and particularly white lead, return to their former \\nmetallic character, they become, in various - ways, black, \\nby the lois of the oxygen, which, as is well known, is drawn \\nfrom them merely by the contact of the light, efpecially \\nwhen ftronp-. '• \\nO '1 \\nIt appears from the preceding theoretical obfervations, that \\none can hope only for a tranfient or deceitful effect from the \\nrefrefhing of oil-paintings with oil, becaufe the harmony of \\nthe tones, which the painter eftablifties as fuited for the mo¬ \\nment, does not proceed with equal fleps, and cannot preferve \\n•itfelf in the like meafure for the courfeof a few years, as each \\ntint, as they fay, ought to increafe, or, to fpeak more properly, \\nto burn in propoxtionto its antiquity. It thence follows, that \\nmere \\n\", '*S On Encau/Iic Painting. \\nmere waffling may be prejudicial to an old painting y and that \\nthe method of refrefhing paintings, as it is called, by daub- \\ning; over the furface from time to time with new drying oil, is \\nhighly prejudicial and ill calculated for the intended purpofe, \\nflneethe oil when it becomes dry contracts in its whole fur- \\nface, carries with it the paint under it, and occafions cracks \\nin the painting. New oil of this kind Gives occafion to mi~ \\nneral paints to be reftored ; but covers the picture with a \\nnew coat of relin, and then of carbon, which arifes from the \\ngradual combuftion, and always caufes more blacknefs, and \\nthe decay of the painting which one wi flies to preferve,. \\nWax, on the other hand, undergoes a change which is very \\ndifferent from that of drying oil. The wax, inftead of be¬ \\ncoming black by the contact of the atmofphere, incrcafes in \\nwhitenefs, and, according to its natural quality, is not dccom- \\npofed in the air, and it does not ftrougly attract the oxygen \\nof the calces or metallic allies which are commonly ufed in \\npainting. Moreover, the fo called earths, which are in them¬ \\nselves white, and are never variable either by the prefence or \\nabfenee of oxygen, cannot be employed in oil-painting, be- \\ncaufe that fluid makes them almofl tranfparent, and caufes \\nthem to remain as it were without body (ccrpo), and not to \\nproduce the wiffled-for effect. That beautiful white, which \\nmay be obffrved on the before-mentioned Egyptian cncauf- \\ntic, is nothing elfe than a Ample earth, and according to \\nmy chemical experiments a chalk (creta,) which is alfo un¬ \\nalterable. If we conlkler this encauftie fragment as belong¬ \\ning to the epoch of the fir ft violent change which the reli¬ \\ngious fyftem of the Egyptians experienced, it will be a fpeci- \\nmen of painting of about 2500 years old; for fuch is the \\nnumber of the years that have elapfed fince Cambyfes over¬ \\nturned the ceremonies and religious world ip of the Egyp¬ \\ntians, not only by the fword, but by the ftill more powerful \\nweapons of ridicule. Dead bodies were embalmed there in \\nthe time of Herodotus; but the cloth in which they were \\nwrapped, or the bandages bound round them, were no longer \\ncim.* painted \\n', 'On Tnncaujltc Painting, 2JJ \\npainted with facred characters. The bodies were only in- \\ndoled in wooden cafes, which were more or lefs ornamented. \\nMany are of opinion, that an expreffion of the bifhop of Hippo \\ngives reafon to aflert that the people in Egypt continued to \\nprepare mummies even till the fifth century; but it muff be \\nobferved that the Egyptians then had adopted the Chriftian \\nreligion; that they no longer ufed hieroglyphieal infcrip- \\ntlons, which in the time of Apuleius were faid to be unin^ \\ntelliffible and forgotten ; and that it was not mummies which \\nwere prepared then, but gabbara, as St. Auguftine fays in \\nhis Orations, that is, dead bodies dried after the manner \\nof mummies.

To remedy this defedt in fome de¬ \\ngree, and as an introdudlion to original papers on the fub- \\njedl promifed to us by an eminent mineralogift, we think \\nproper to lay before our readers the following tranilation of \\nThe Abbe HaUT's Theory of Cryftalllzatmu From \\nVol. XVII. of the Annales de Chimie. \\nI GAVE in this Journal, fome years ago, a (hort account \\nof the theory of cryftallization •, but that paper may be \\nconfidered only as a {hort fketch, and more calculated for \\nthofe who wifh not to be entirely ignorant of the fubjedl, \\nthan for thofe delirous of becoming thoroughly acquainted \\nwith its principles and refults. In the prefent paper I pro- \\npofe to afford the .latter an opportunity of obtaining their \\nobjedl, by prefenting them with the theory required, and \\nwith all the fadls neceffary to give them a jull idea of the \\nlaws to which it is fubjedt, and of the progrefs by which it \\nhas been carried to fuch a degree of generality, that an im- \\nD x menfe \\n\", \"a 6 theory of Crystallization. \\nttienfe number of fadts, formerly unconnected, now become \\narranged, as if of t'hemfelves, around a (ingle one on which \\nthey depend, and which ferves to conned! them all by mutual \\nrelations. \\nI confefs, however, that this theory can be well underftood \\nonly by the help of analytical calculations *. Befides the \\nadvantage which analyfis has of involving in the fame for¬ \\nmula the folations of an infinite number of different pro¬ \\nblems, it alone can give to the theory the character of abfo- \\n3ute certainty, by producing refults perfectly agreeable to \\nthofe we receive from obfervation. \\nNotwkhftanding thefe confiderations, 1 thought it would \\nbe better for thofe unacquainted with the fcience of calcu¬ \\nlation, if I adhered to fimple re a foiling, accompanied by \\ngeometrical figures, which are fo ufeful in afiifting the ima- \\ngination to conceive the arrangement of thofe fmall folids \\nthat concur to form a cryftal, but which were wanting to \\nthe fir ft paper. \\nThis arrangement I call fracture^ as oppofed to the term \\norganization, which expreffes the far more compound me- \\nehanifm of animals .and plants. \\nIf this procedure be lefs direct, lefs expeditious, and 3efj \\nI \\nprecife , and if it requires us to attend to thofe details \\nwhich algebra pafles over in order to conduct us fpeedily \\nto its object, it is at leaft attended with this advantage, \\nthat the mind by its means perceives better the connexion of \\nthe different parts of the whole under its cdnfideratl-on. \\nI. Mechanical Divifion of Cryf ah» \\nIt is known that the fame mineral fubftnnce is fufceptible \\nof many different forms well defined, fome of which do not \\nprefect, on the firft view, any common point of refemblance \\nthat feems to indicate their relation. If we compare, for \\nexample, calcareous fpar in a regular hexaedral prifm with \\n* See Memoires de J’Acad, des Sciences,. An 17^0.. \\nthe \\n\", '^Theory of CryflaUizaiion. 37 \\nthe rhomboid * of the fame fpar whofe large angle is about \\ni©i|°, we {hall, at firft, be inclined to believe that each of \\nthefe two forms is entirely foreign to the other. But that \\npoint of union which efcapes our notice, when we confine \\nourfelves to the confideration of the exterior form, becomes \\nfenfible when we penetrate into the internal mechanifm of \\nthe (trudture. Let me here then be permitted to trace \\nthings from their origin, by relating how the obfervation \\nfrom which I fet out, and which has become the key of th.£ \\nwhole theory, firll prefented itfelf to my mind. \\nI was holding in my hand a hexaedral prifm of calcareous \\nfpar, fimilar to the one I have mentioned, and which had \\nfallen from a group of which it formed a part. The frac¬ \\nture prefented a very fmooth farface, fituated obliquely, like \\nthe trapezium p f u t (Jig. i), and which made an angle of \\n1350, both with the refidue a b cf p h of the bafe, and with \\nthe remainder t u e f of the plane i n e f Obferving that \\nthe cuneiform fegment p f u t i n feparated by this fradlure \\nfrom the cryftal had for vertex one of the edges of the bafe, \\nthat is to fay the edge i //, 1 wiftied to know if I could detach \\na fecond fegment in the part to which the next edge c 11 be¬ \\nlonged, by employing for that purpofe the blade of a knife \\n* ^ gtve the name of rhomboid to a parallelopipedon ae (fig. 4) termi¬ \\nnated by fix rhombufcs equal and fimilar. In every rhomboid two of \\nthe folid angles fuch as a, e, oppofite to each other, are formed by the junc- \\nt on of three equal plane angles. Each of the other fix folid angles is \\nformed by a plane angle equal to each of the preceding, and by two other \\nangles of a different meafure, but equal to each other. The points a,e, are \\nthe fummits, and the line a e the axis. In any one whatever a b df of the \\nrhombufes, which compofe the furface, the angle a, contiguous to the fum- \\nmir, is called the fuperior angle; the angle d the inferior angle j and the \\nangles b and f are the lateral angles. The fides ab, af are the fuperior \\nedges and the fides bd, df, the inferior edges ; b f is the horizontal dia¬ \\ngonal ; and a d the oblique diagonal. The rhomboid is obtufe or acute ac¬ \\ncording as the angles of the fummits are obtufe or acute.

The fourth edge a b refilled the inftrument like \\nthe fecond \\\\ but the next one a h yielded eafily to the me¬ \\nchanical divifion, and prefented a third trapezium of as fine \\na polith as the other two. It is almoff unneceffary to add, \\nthat the fixth edge i h remained indivifible, like the fourth \\nand the fecond. \\nI then proceeded to the inferior bafe cl e f g \\\\ r, and obfer- \\nvation proved to me that the edges of this bafe, which admit¬ \\nted feclions like the preceding, were not the edges ef\\\\ dri gkx \\ncorrefponding with thofe I had found divifible towards the \\nupper part, but the intermediate edges de> vy, gf. The tra¬ \\npezium /q y v represents the fedlion made below the edge kr. \\nThis fedlion is evidently parallel to that of the trapezium \\npfu and in the like manner the four other trapeziums are \\nparallel two to two. But thefe different fedlions being in \\nthe direction of the natural joining of the laminae, I eafily \\nfucceeded to obtain more fedlions parallel to each of them, \\nwhile it was impoflible to divide the cryftal in any other di- \\nredlion. By continuing this mechanical divifion, determined \\nby the paralldifm above mentioned, I came to new fedlions, \\nalways nearer the axis of the prifm ; and when thefe fedtion® \\nhad made the remainders of the two bafes to difappear, the \\nprifm was transformed into the folid OX (fig. 2) terminated \\nby twelve pentagons, parallel two to two, of which thofe at \\nthe extremities SAOIR, GIODE, BAODC, on the one fide, \\nand KNPQF, MNPXU, ZQPXY, on the other, were the \\nrelults of the mechanical divifion, and had their common \\nvertices O, P, fituated in the centres of the bafes of the prifm \\n(fig. i). The fix lateral pentagons RSUXY, ZYRIG, &c. \\n(fig. 2) were the remains of the planes of the fame prifm. \\nIn proportion as, I multiplied the fedlions, always parallel \\nto the preceding, the lateral pentagon® decreafed in height; \\n', '^theory of CryfaUization. 39 \\natid at a certain term the points RG becoming confounded \\nwith the points YZ, the points SR with the points UY, &c. \\nthere remained nothing of the pentagons in quefiion but \\nthe triangles YIZ, UitY, &c. (fig 3). Beyond that term \\ndie fedtions happening to pafs over the furface of thefe tri¬ \\nangles diminifhed gradually their extent, until, at length, \\nthefe triangles were loft ; and then the folid which arofe \\nfrom the hexaedral prifm became a rhomboid a e [fig. 4) en¬ \\ntirely like that commonly diftinguifhed under the name of \\nIcelandic fpar. \\nA refult fo unexpe&ed made me immediately conceive the \\nidea of fubje£ting the other calcareous cryftals to the fame \\nproof; and all yielded to the mechanical divifion in fuch a \\nmanner, that, when the external faces had difappeared, the \\nkind of nucleus which remained under the inftrument was \\nftill a rhomboid of the fame form as the firft. The only \\nthing neceffary was to find the diredlion of the fections \\nwhich conducted to the central rhomboid. \\nTo extract, for example, this rhomboid from that fpar \\ncalled commonly the lenticular, and which is a much more \\nobtufe rhomboid, having its great plane angle equal to \\n1140 i8; 56\", it was neceffary to begin at the two vertices, \\nmaking the fedfions pafs through the leffer diagonals of the \\nfaces. If it were wiftied, on the contrary, to get at the nu¬ \\ncleus of the rhomboidal fpar with acute vertices *, it would \\nbe neceffary to dire£t the fedlioris of the planes parallel to \\nthe edges adjacent to the vertices, and in fuch a manner \\nthat each of them Ihould be equally inclined to the planes \\nit cuts. \\nThefe refults are the more worthy of attention, as it would \\nat firft feem that cryftallization, after having once adopted \\nthe rhomboid, in regard to one determined fpecies of mine¬ \\nral, ought always to re-produce it with the fame angles. But \\n* This rhomboid, as well as the preceding, will be farther explained irk \\n$he courfe of the prefent article. \\nD 4 the \\n', '\\'Theory of CryJlaUization*.. \\nthe paradox arifing from this\\'diverfity of appearance is ex¬ \\nplained by the double ufe of the rhomboidal form, which \\nferves here to difguife itfelf, and which conceals fixed and \\nconftant chara&erifing marks under a variable outfide. \\nIf we take a cryftal of another nature, fuch as a cube of \\nfluor fpar, the nucleus will have a different form. This, \\nin the prefent cafe, will be an odtaedron, to which we {hall \\narrive by taking off the eight folid angles of the cube. Heavy \\nfpar will produce, for nucleus, a right prifm, with rhomboidal \\nbales ; feld fpar an oblique-angled parallelopipedon, but not \\nrhomboidal * *, the apatite or beryl a right hexaedral prifm ; \\nthe adamantine fpar a rhomboid, a little fharpeneff ; blend \\na dodecaedron, with rhomboidal planes; iron of the illand \\nof Elba, a cube, &c. and each of thefe forms will be conflant \\nin regard to the whole fpecies, fo that its angles will undergo, \\nno variation of importance; and if an attempt be made to \\ndivide the cry Hal in any other direction, we (hall not be able \\nto find a joining. Nothing will be obtained but undefined \\nfragments: in a word, it will be.broken rather than divided. \\nThefe folids, infcribed, each, in all the folids of the fame \\nfpecies, ought to be ccnfidered as the real primitive forms \\non which all the other forms depend. All minerals, I con- \\nfefs, are not fufceptibJe of being divided mechanically, but \\nthere aie a greater number than I at firft thought; and with \\nregard to thofe cryffals which have hitherto refilled my ef¬ \\nforts to find their natural joinings, I have remarked that their \\nfurface, ftriated in a certain direction, or the relation of their, \\ndifferent forms among thofe which belong to the fame fub- \\nftance, often prefent indications of their ftrudture ; and that, \\nreafoning from their analogy with other divifible cryffals, \\nwe may determine that ffrudlure at lead with great pro¬ \\nbability. \\nI call fqcondary forms all thofe that differ from the primi¬ \\ntive form. We fhall fee, hereafter, that the number of thefe \\nV \\'l * t. \\' \\' \\' \" K i \\\\ \\' ‘ + \\nf Mem. de PAcad. des Sciences, An 1784, p. 7. \\nforms \\n', '4t \\n’Theory of Cryjlalliz ation, \\nforms has limits, which can be determined by theory, ac¬ \\ncording to the laws to which*the ftrudture ofcryftals is fab- \\njedted. , \\nThe folid of the primitive form, obtained by means of the \\noperation above explained,, may be fubdivided in a difedliom \\nparallel to i-s different faces : all the enveloping matter is \\nequally divifible by fedtions parallel to the faces of the pri¬ \\nmitive form. It thence follows that the parts detached by \\nthe help of all thefe fedfions are fimilar, and differ only in \\ntheir bulk, which continues to decreafe in proportion as the \\ndivifion is carried Hill farther. We, however, muff except \\nthofe which are near to the faces of the fecondary folid j for, \\nthefe faces not being parallel to thofe of the primitive form, \\nthe fragments which have one of their facets taken, in the \\nfame faces cannot entirely refemble thofe detached towards \\nthe middle of the cryftal. For example, the fragments of the \\nhexaedral prifm (fig. i), the external facets of which make \\npart of the bafes or of the planes, have not, in that refpedl, \\nthe fame figure as thofe fituated nearer the centre, and of \\nwhich the facets are all parallel to the fedfions p f u t9 \\nl q y v, &c. But theory, as I fhall (hew, removes all the \\ncmbarraffment which, on the firft view, arifes from that \\ndiverfity, and reduces the whole to an unity of figure. \\nBut the divifion of the cryftal into fmall fimilar folids has \\na term beyond which we fliould come to particles fo fmall, \\nthat they cpuld no longer be divided without analyfing them; \\nthat is to fay, without deftroying the nature of the fubftance. \\nI ftop at that term; and I give to the corpufcula we ftiould \\ninfulate, if our organs and inftr-uments were fufficiently \\ndelicate, the name of mtegral molecule. It is very probable \\nthat thefe molecule are thofe which were fufpended in the \\nfluid in which the cryftallization was effedled. But my \\nreaders may judge for themfelves. We. may, however, \\n■with truth, affert, that, by the afliftance of thefe molecular, \\ntheory reduces to Ample laws the different metamorphofes of \\ncryftals, \\n', \"4% Theory of Cry/Ia!fixation. \\ncryflals, and arrives at refults which exadlly reprefent thofc \\n% \\n©£ nature y and this is the only end 1 propofed. \\nWhen the nucleus is a parailelopipedon, that is to fay, a \\nfolld with fix parallel faces, two to two, like the cube, the \\nrhomboid, &c. and this folid dees not admit of any other \\nc&vifions than thofc made in the direction of the faces, it is \\nevident that the molecule refill ting from fubdivifion, both \\nerf the nucleus and of the enveloping matter, arc fimilar to. \\nthe nucleus. In other cafes the form of the moleculae differs, \\nfrom that of the nucleus. There are alfo cryflals which, by \\nhelp of the mechanical divifion, yield particles of different \\nfigures, combined together throughout the whole extent of \\nthefe cryflals.

The pofition of this cube may be eafily conceived \\nby infpedfing fig. 6, where it is feen that the fmall diagonals \\nDC, CG, GF, FD, of the four faces of the dodecaedron, \\nunited around the fame folid angle L, form a fquare, CDFG, \\nBut there are fix folid angles compofed of the four planes, \\nviz. the angles L, O, -E, N, R, P, (fig. 5) j and, conv¬ \\neniently, if feftions are made to pafs through the fmall diago-- \\nnals of the faces which concur to the formation of thefe \\nfolid angles, we {hail fuecefiively uncover fix fquares, which \\nwill be the faces of the primitive cube, and three of which \\nare reprefented (fig- 6), viz. CDFG, AFsCD, BCGH. \\nThis cube would evidently be an aflemblage of integral \\ncubic moleculae, and it would be necefiary that each of the \\npyramids, fuch as LDCGF (fig- 6), which reft on the faces, \\nfhould itfelf be compofed of cubes equal to each other, and \\nto thofe forming the nucleus. \\nTo make it more apparent how this might take place, I \\n{hall point out the means of making an artificial dodecaedron, \\nbv employing a certain number of fmall cubes, the affortment \\nof which will be an imitation of that of the moleculse em¬ \\nployed by nature in the formation of the dodecaedron we \\nare here confidering. \\nLet ABGF (fig. 7) be a cube compofed of 729 fmall \\ncubes equal to one another, in which cafe each face of the \\nwhole cube will contain 81 fquares, nine on each fide, which \\nwill be the external faces of as many partial cubes, reprefenta- \\ntives of moleculae.

Obfervations on Iron and Steel. By JOSEPH CoLLTER. \\nFrom the Tranfa&ions of the Manchefter Society. \\n\\\\lVith a Plate3 No. III.} ' \\nAf rER examining the works of different authors wh<$ \\nhave written on the fubjea of making iron and heel, I am \\nperfuaded that the accounts given by them of the neceffary \\nproceffes and operations are extremely imperfect: Chemifts \\nhave examined and defcribed the various compound mine¬ \\nrals containing iron with great accuracy, but have been lefs \\nattentive to their reduaion. This obfervation more parti* \\ncularly applies to ffeel, of the making of which I have not \\nfeen any correft account. It is lingular to obferve how very • \\nimperfedly the cementation of iron has been defcribed by \\nmen of great eminence in the fcience of chemiflry. Fomx \\ncroy hates the length of time neceffary for the cementation \\no£ \\n\", \"Observations on Iron and Steel \\n«f iron to be about twelve hours j but it is difficult to difco \\nver whether he alludes to call or to bar Reel : for he fays* \\nthat ffiort bars of iron are to be put into an earthen box \\nwith a cement, and clofed up. Now heel is made from bars \\nof iron of the ufual length and thicknefs : but call Heel is \\nmade according to the procefs defended by Fourcroy, with \\nthis effential difference—the operation is begun upon bar \\nHeel, and not bar iron. \\nMr. Nicholfon is equally unfortunate in the account given \\nin his Chemical Dictionary. He fays that the ufual time \\nrequired for the cementation of iron is from 6 to 10 hours \\nv * \\nand cautions us again It continuing the cementation too \\nlong ; whereas the operation, from the beginning to the end* \\nrequires 16 days at leaft. In other parts of the operation he \\nis equally defective, confounding tire making of bar with \\nthat of caff Heel, and not fully defending either. In ffieak- \\ni ing of the ufes -of Heel, or rather.of what conffitutes its fu- \\nperiority, Mr. Nicliolfon is alfo deficient. He obferves that \\n‘fits molt ufeful and advantageous property is that of becom¬ \\ning extremely hard when plunged into water.” He lias here \\n; forgotten every thing refpe&ing the temper and tempering \\nof Heel inftruments, of which, however, he takes feme no¬ \\ntice in the fame page. “ Plunging into water ” requires a \\nlittle explanation : for, if very hot Heel be immerfed in .cold \\nwater without great caution, it will crack, nay fo me times- \\nbreak to pieces. If is h®wever neceffary to be done, in order \\nto prevent the Heel from growing loft, and returning to the \\nHate of malleable iron •, for, were it permitted to cool in the \\nopen air, the carbon which it holds in combination would \\nbe diffipated*. I fhall at p'refent confine my remarks to \\nthv_ operations periormed on iron in Sheffield and its nelpdi- \\nbourhood, from whence various communications have beera \\ntranfmitted to me by vefident friends, and where I have my- \\nffilf feen the operations repeatedly performed. The iroia \\nIt is the opinion of Tome metallurgies, that a partial aMlraaioii of \\n«fygen takes place, by plunging hot metal into cold water. \\nmat!* \\n\", '4§ Obfervations on Iron and Steel. \\nmade in that part of Yorkfhire is procured from ores found \\nin the neighbourhood, which are of the argillaceous kind* \\nbut intermixed with a large proportion of foreign matter. \\nThefe, however, are frequently combined with richer ores \\nfrom Cumberland and other places. The ore is firft roafled \\nwith cinders for three days in the open air, in order to expel \\nthe lulphureous or arfenical parts, and afterwards taken to \\nthe furnaces, fome of which are conftrudled fo that their in¬ \\nternal cavity has the form of two four-fided pyramids joined \\nbafe to bafe ; but thofe mo ft commonly ufed are of a conical \\nform, from forty to fifty feet high. The furnace is charged \\nat the top wdth equal parts of coal-cinder and lime-flone. \\nThe lime-flone a£ts as a flux, at the fame time that it fup- \\nplies a fuflicient quantity of earthy matter, to be converted \\ninto fcorise, which are neceflary to defend the reduced metal \\nfrom calcination, when it comes near the lower part of the \\nfurnace. The fire, is lighted at the bottom ; and the heat is \\nexcited by means of twro pair of large bellows blowing al¬ \\nternately. The quantity of air generally thrown into the fur¬ \\nnace is from 1000 to 1200 fquare feet in a minute. The \\nair paffes through a pipe, the diameter of which is from twcf \\ninches and a quarter to tvro and three quarters wide. The \\ncompreffion of air which is necefTary is equal to a column \\nof water four feet and a half high. The ore melts as it \\npaffes through the fire, and is collected at the bottom, where \\nit is maintained in a liquid flate. The flag, which falls down \\nwith the fufed metal, is let off by means of an opening in \\nthe fide of the furnace, at the diferetion of the workmen. \\nWhen a fuflicient quantity of regulus, or imperfedlly re¬ \\nduced metal, is accumulated at the bottom of the furnace \\n(which ufually happens every eight hours), it is let oft into \\nmoulds, to form it for the purpofes intended, fuch as can¬ \\nnon or pig iron.—Crude iron is diflinguifhed into white, \\nblack, and-grey. The white is the leaft reduced, and more \\nbrittle than the other two; the bteck is that with which 3 \\n} \\nlarge quantity of fuel has been ufed j and the grey is that \\n9 which \\n', 'Obfervations oh Iron ohd Steel. \\nwhich has been reduced with a fufficient quantity of fuel, of \\nwhich it contains a part in folution. The operation of re¬ \\nfining crude iron confifts in burning the combuftible matter \\nwhich it holds in folution ; at the fame time that the re¬ \\nmaining iron is more perfectly reduced, and acquires a \\nfibrous texture. For this purpofe, the pigs of caft iron are \\ntaken to the forge, where they are firft put into what is called \\nthe refinery ; which is an open charcoal fire, urged by a pair \\nof bellows, worked by water or a {team-engine ; but the \\ncomprefiion of air in the refinery ought to be lefs than that \\nin the blaft-furnace. After the metal is melted, it is let out \\nof the fire by the workmen to difcharge the fcorise, and then \\nreturned and fubjedfted to the blaft as before. This opera¬ \\ntion is fometimes repeated two or three times before any \\nappearance of malleability (or what the workmen call coming \\ninto nature) takes place; this they know by the metal’s firft \\nafiuming a granular appearance, the particles appearing to \\nrepel each other, or at leaft to have no figns of attract \\ntion. Soon afterwards they begin to adhere, the attraction \\nincreafes very rapidly, and it is with great difficulty that the \\nwhole is prevented from running into one mafs, which it is \\ndefirable to avoid, it being more convenient to {lamp fmall \\npieces into thin cakes : this is done by putting the iron imme¬ \\ndiately under the forge-hammer, and beating it into pieces \\nabout an inch thick, which eafily break from the reft during \\nthe operation. Thefe fmall pieces are then collected and \\npiled to the height of about ten inches upon circular {tones, \\nwhich are an inch thick and nine inches in diameter. They \\nare afterwards put into a furnace, in which the fire is rever¬ \\nberated upon them until they are in a femi-fiuid ftate. The \\nworkmen then take one out of the furnace, and draw it into \\na bar under the hammer; which being finifhed, they apply \\nthe bar to another of the piles of femi-fluid metal, to which \\nit quickly cements, is taken again to the hammer, the bar \\nfirft drawn ferving as a handle, and drawn down as before* \\nThe imperfections in the bars are remedied by putting them \\nVoL* *• E * into \\n\\\\ \\n', 'Obfervatlons on Iron and Steel \\ninto another fire called the ehafery, and again fubje£tir?g \\nthem to the aclion of the forge-hammer. \\nThe above method is now mod in ufe, and is called flou- \\nTifhing 5 but the iron made by this procefs is in no refpeft \\nfuperior to that which I am going to defcribe. It is how¬ \\never not fo expenfive, and requires lefs labour. \\nThe procefs for refining crude iron, which was mod \\ncommon previous to the introduction of flotnriffnng, is as \\nfollows : \\nThe pigs of caff iron are put into the refinery, as above, \\nwhere they remain until they have acquired a confidence \\nrefembling pade, which happens in about two hours and a \\nhalf. The iron is then taken out of the refinery, and laid \\nupon a cad iron plate on the floor, and beaten by the work¬ \\nmen with hand-hammers, to knock off the cinders and other \\nextraneous matters which adhere to the metal. It is after¬ \\nwards taken to the forge-hammer, and beaten fird gently, till \\nit has obtained a little tenacity; then the middle part of \\nthe piece is drawn into a bar about half an inch thick, \\nthree inches broad, and four feet long, leaving at each end \\na thick fquare lump of imperfect iron. In this form it is \\ncalled anCony. It is now taken to the fire called the ehafery, \\nmade of common coal, after which the two ends are drawn \\nout into the form of the middle, and the operation is \\niinifhed. \\nThere is alfo a third method of rendering crude iron mal¬ \\nleable, which, I think, promifes to be abundantly more advan¬ \\ntageous than either of the two former, as it will difpenle \\nboth with the refinery and ehafery ; and nothing more will \\nbe neceffary than a reverberating furnace, and a furnace to \\ngive the metal a malleable heat, about the middle of the \\noperation. The large forge-hammer will alfo fall intodifre- \\npute, but in its place muff be fubiVitntcd metal rollers of \\ndifferent capacities, which, like the forge-hammer, muff be \\nIvorked either by a water-wheel or a fteam-engine. \\nIt is by the operation of the forge-hammer Of metal \\nrollers. \\n', \"'Observations oil Iron and Steel. \\nrollers, that the iron is deprived of the remaining portion of \\nimpurity, and acquires a fibrous texture. \\nThe iron made by the three foregoing procefles is equally \\nvaluable, for by any of them the metal is rendered pure ; but \\nafter thofe different operations are finifhed, it is the opinion \\nof many of the mod judicious workers in iron, that laying \\nit in a damp place for fome time improves its quality ; and \\nto this alone fome attribute the fuperiority of foreign iron, \\nmore time elapfing between making and ufing the metal. \\no the latter part of this opinion 1 cart by no means accede, \\nas it is well known that the Swedifii * ores contain much \\nlefs heterogeneous matter than ours, and are generally \\nmuch richer, as they ufually yield about 70 per quintal of \\npure iron, whereas the average of ours is not more than \\n30 or 40 f: add to this, that the Swedifh ores are fmelced \\nin wood fires, which gives the iron art additional fuperiority. \\nIron inftruments are cafe-hardefied by heating them in a \\ncinder or charcoal fire ; but if the firfl be lifed, a quantity of \\nold leather or bones muft be burnt in the fire, to fupply the \\nmetal with carbon. The fire muft be urged by a pair of \\nbellows to a fufficient degree of heat, and the whole opera¬ \\ntion is ufually completed in an hour. \\nThe procefs for cafe-hardening iron is in fa& the fame as \\nfor converting iron into fteel, but not continued fo long, as \\nthe furface only of the article is to be impregnated with car¬ \\nbon. Some attempts huve been made to give caft-irori, by \\ncafe-hardening, the texture and ductility of fteel; but they \\nhave not been very fuccefsful. Table and pen-knife blades \\nhave been made of it; and* when ground, have had a pretty \\ngood appearance ; but the edges are not firm, and they foon \\nlofe their polifti. Common table knives are frequently made \\n.t>f this metal. The cementatioii of iron converts it into \\n* Steel is commonly made of Swedifh iron. \\n■f The iron made from the ore found in the neighbourhood of Sheffield \\ncontains a great deal of phofphate of iron or fiderite, which renders the \\njnetal brittle when cold. \\nE % fteelj \\n\", '52 Obfervations on Iron and Steel* \\nfteel, a fubftance intermediate between crude and malleable \\n* \\niron. \\nThe furnaces for making fteel are conical buildings ; about \\nthe middle of which are two troughs of brick or fire-ftone, \\nwhich will hold about four tons of iron in the bar. At the \\nbottom is a long grate for fire. The fteel furnace, how¬ \\never, is not well adapted for defcription. I fliall therefore \\navail myfelf of an accurate drawing, which was communi¬ \\ncated to me by a gentleman converfant with the manufacture, \\nand which is copied in the plate. A layer of charcoal-duft \\nis put upon the bottom of the trough, and upon that a layer \\nof bar iron, and fo on alternately until the trough is full. It \\nis then covered over with clay to keep out the air; which, if \\nadmitted, would effectually prevent the cementation. When \\nthe fire is put into the grate, the heat paffes round by means \\nof flues, made at intervals, by the (ides of the trough. The fire \\nis continued until the converfion is complete, which gene¬ \\nrally happens in about eight or ten days. There is a hole in \\nthe fide, by which the workmen draw out a bar occafionally, \\nto fee how far the tranfmutation has proceeded. This they \\ndetermine by the blifters upon the furface of the bars. \\nIf they be not fufficiently changed, the hole is again clofed \\ncarefully, to exclude the air; but if, on the contrary, the \\nchange be complete, the fire is extinguifhed, and the fteel is \\nleft to cool for about eight days more, when the procefs for \\nmaking bliftered fteel is finifhed. For fmall wares, the bars \\nare drawn, under the tilt hammer, to about half an inch \\nbroad and of an inch thick. The change wrought on \\nbliftered fteel by the tilt hammer, is nearly fimilar to that \\neffected on iron from the refinery by the forge hammer. It \\nis made of a more firm texture, and drawn into convenient \\nforms for ufe. German fteel is made by breaking the bars \\nof bliftered fteel into fmall pieces, and then putting a num¬ \\nber of them into a furnace ; after which they are welded to¬ \\ngether and drawn to about eighteen inches long; then dou¬ \\nbled and welded again, and finally drawn to the fize and fhape \\n♦ 7 required \\n', \"Obfervations on Iron and Steel. \\nrequired for ufe. This is alfo called {hear fteel, and is \\nfuperior in quality to the common tilted fteel. Caft fteel \\nis alfo made from the common bliftered fteel. The bars are \\nbroken, and put into large crucibles with a flux. The cru¬ \\ncible is then clofed up with a lid of the fame ware, and placed \\nin a wind furnace. By the introdu&ion of a greater or \\nfmaller quantity of flux, the metal is made harder or fofter. \\nWhen the fufion is complete, the metal is caft into in¬ \\ngots, and then called ingot fteel; and that which afterwards \\nundergoes the operation of tilting, is called tilted caft fteel. \\nThe caft fteel is the moft valuable, as its texture is the moft \\ncompad, and it admits of the fineft polifti. Sir T. Frankland \\nhas communicated a procefs, in the Tranfa&ions of the Royal \\nSociety*, for welding caft fteel and malleable iron together; \\nwhich, he fays, is done by giving the iron a malleable, and \\nthe fteel a white heat ; but, from the experiments which \\nhave been made at my requeft, it appears, that it is only foft \\ncaft fteel, little better than common fteel, that will weld to \\niron: pure fteel will not; for, at the heat defcribed by Sir \\nT. the beft caft fteel either melts, or will not bear the ham¬ \\nmer. It may here be obferved, as was mentioned before, \\nthat fteel is an intermediate ftate between crude and malle¬ \\nable iron, except in the circumRanee of its reduction being \\ncomplete ; for, according to the experiments of Reaumur \\nand Bergman, fteel contains more hydrogen gas than caft \\niron, but lefs than malleable iron ;—lefs plumbago than the \\nfirft, but more than the latter ;—an equal portion of man- \\nganefe with each lefs liliceous earth than either;—more \\niron than the firft, but lefs than the fecond. Its fufibility is \\nlikewife intermediate between the bar iron and the crude.' \\nWhen fteel has been gradually cooled from a ftate of igni¬ \\ntion, it is malleable and foft, like bar iron; but when ig¬ \\nnited and plunged into cold water, it has the hardnefs and \\nbrittlenefs of crude iron. From the foregoing fadls we are \\njuftifled in drawing the fame conclufions with Reaumur and \\n* Phil. Tranf, 1795. \\nE 3 \\nBergman* \\n1 \\n\", '54 Obfervatlons on Iron and Steel \\nBergman, but which have been more perfectly explained by \\nVandermonde, Berthollet, and Monge, that crude iron is a \\nregulus, the redu&ion of which is not complete ; and which \\nconfequently will differ according as it approaches more or \\nlefs to the metallic date. Forged iron, when previoufly well \\nrefined, is the pured metal $ for it is then the mod malle¬ \\nable and the mod dudtile, its power of welding is the greated, \\nand it acquires the magnetic quality fooned. Steel confids \\nof iron perfectly reduced and combined with charcoal 5 and \\nthe various differences in blidered deel, made of the fame \\nmetal, confid in the greater or lefs proportion of charcoal \\nimbibed. Iron gains, by being converted into deel, about \\nT^- part of its weight. In order to harden deel, it mud be \\nput into a clean charcoal/ coal or cinder fire, blown to a \\nfufficient degree of heat by bellows, The workmen fay, \\nthat neither iron nor deel will harden properly without a \\nblad. When the fire is fufficiently hot, the indrument in« \\ntended to be hardened mud be put in, and a gradual blaft \\nfrom the bellows continued until the metal has acquired a \\nregular red heat: it is then to be carefully quenched in \\ncold water. If the deel be too hot when immerfed in wa-? \\nfcer, the grain will be of a rough and coarfe texture ; but if \\nof a proper degree of heat, it will be perfedly fine. Saws \\nand fome other articles are quenched in oil. Steel is tem¬ \\npered by again fubjedting it to the adlion of the fire. The \\nindrument to be tempered we will fuppofe to be a razor \\nmade of cad deel. Fird rub it upon a grit done until it is \\nbright, then put the back upon the fire, and in a fhort time \\nthe edge will become of a light draw colour, whild the bacl<; \\nis blue. The draw colour denotes a proper temper, either \\nfor a razor, graver, or pen-knife. Spring knives require a \\ndark brown ; fciffars a light brown or draw colour ; Torks or \\ntable-knives a blue. The blue colour marks the proper tem¬ \\nper fo.r fwords, watch-fprings, or any thing requiring elafti- \\npity. rIhe fprings for pen knives are covered over with oil \\nbefore they are expofed to the fire to temper. \\nJixpla- \\n', '55 \\n0bfervations on Iron a?id Steel* \\n# \\nExplanation of the Plate. \\nFig. i is a plan of the furnace, and fig. 2 is a fedlion of it \\ntaken at the line AB.

From the Annales de Chimie,^ \\nVol. XXV- \\nTo increafe the number of dyeing fubftances, and to be \\nable to vary the tone and {hades of the different known \\ncolours, is an objedl of no fmall utility. Several manufac¬ \\ntures, as is well known, have been indebted for their reputa¬ \\ntion and Qredit to the poffeffion of„a particular dye. \\nWithout fpeaking of the Tyrian purple, who is ignorant \\nhow much value the modern fcarlet has given to the Dutch \\ncloths and to thofe of the Gobelins ? Who does not know \\nthat the beautiful black of Florence, which has never yet \\nbeen imitated, has raifed the Florentine fluffs all over Europe \\nto a price to which that of no other country ever attained ? \\nScarlet and black belong to that clafs of colours called \\nnolle oxfxed, becaufe they are not fufceptible of being flained, \\nand becaufe they experience no alteration either from the air \\nor from light. The beautiful red colour alfo given to filk by \\nfafflower is reckoned among the noble colours, though it \\ndoes not withfland the influence of thefe two agents, which \\nfoon deflroy it or render it pale. \\nAll other red dyes for filk, in order to be durable, mull be \\ncompofed, in part, of cochineal, which is a colouring fub- \\nftance exceedingly conftant. \\nt » \\nArgol and all the other lichens produce a very beautiful \\nvioletbut the fun alters this colour and makes it turn \\nblue. \\nI am of opinion, therefore, that if means could be dif- \\ncovered to compofe, without cochineal, colours graduated \\nfrom the mofl delicate to the darkefl violet purple, which \\nmight be proof againft the action of acids and of the air, in¬ \\nfinite advantages would thence refult to the manufadlurersof \\ncloth and to the public. \\nIt \\n', \"/ \\nA Dye from the Leaves of the Aloe. jy \\nIt was in hopes of difcovering fuch a colour that I dire&ed \\nmy refearches towards a fubftance which hitherto has not \\nbeen ranked among thofe called colouring fubftances. \\nI was perfuaded that the matter of the brilliant colours \\nprefented to us in thofe fruits, flowers, and plants, which \\nhave undergone a fpontaneous alteration, pre-exifts in the \\nmafs of the fluids that circulate in thofe organs, where it is \\ndifperfed or concealed ; and that to be able to turn it to ad*, \\nvantage, nothing would be wanting but a method to feparate \\nit, and to modify it in a proper manner. \\nThe cochineal infect, which lives on the nopal (caBus coc- \\ncenilifer), can extradl with its probofcis the red juice, or juice \\nfufceptible of becoming red, of that plant; which afterwards \\ncommunicates its colour to the infeft, and which, in my \\nopinion, is the fame as that exhibited to us naked in the ripe \\nfruit of the fame plant. \\nThe beautiful fcarlet colour aflumed by the dead leaves of \\nfome fpecies of ftrawberry blite (hlitum) is not perhaps \\nbrought forwards but in confequence of the decompofition \\nof the dead leaf. Would it be impoflible then for art to \\nfeparate this colour, and to modify it in the like manner ? \\nHaving obferved that the fucculent leaves of the aloe fuc- \\n(otrina anguf folia, as they dried on the plants, aflumed an \\nagreeable violet colour, I tried to feparate the colouring mat- \\nter, or principles of that fine colour, from the living leaves. \\nI found by experiments, that acids as well as alkalis \\nfpeedilygave to this almofl colourlefs juice a red colour, and \\nformed a fucceflive precipitation of colouring molecula? \\nwhich had the fame colour. \\nOxygen gas produced the like effect \\\\ and it is highly \\npleafing to fee how the juice of aloes, merely by being ex- \\npofed to the air, with or without the contaft of the light, \\nfuccefllvely reddens, beginning at the parts more immediately \\nin contact, and is gradually converted into a very dark and \\nlively violet purple. \\nv - ' This \\n\", 'A Dye from the Leaves of the Aloe. \\nThis juice then produces a fuperb tranfparent colour with¬ \\nout body, highly proper for works in miniature, and which \\nwhen diilolved in water may ferve alfo, either cold or warm, \\nfor dyeing filk from the lighted: to the darkeft (hade. \\nSilk, even without a mordant, (trikes and becomes impreg¬ \\nnated with this dye. It is equally attra&ed by fulphurated \\nfilk, though the latter is fo little difpofed to afliime any colour \\nwhatever. \\nThe aloe, indeed, is not a plant indigenous in our climates \\\\ \\nbut this is an inconvenience which it has in common with \\nalmoft all fubftances ufed for dyeing, and even with a great \\nnumber of thofe which ferve us as food. The juice might \\nbe procured from Socotora itfelf, not fuch as it is found in \\ncommerce infpiiTated by fire, but dried in the air, or prepared \\nby an acid. \\nBefides, as this plant grows without any difficulty in our \\nbotanical gardens, we may hope to multiply it enough by \\ncultivation, particularly in the fouthern parts of Italy, in \\norder to extradt from it the juice ourfelves. \\nThe value of this new colour may be readily difcovered, \\nwhen we obferve that, by its property of not being altered \\nby acids or alkalis, it podefies the uncommon quality of not *\\nbeing fufceptible of becoming fpotted. \\nWhen we confider alfo that the oxygen, which difcolours \\nour cloths and filks fo as to render them white, is, as one \\nmay fay, the principle which develops the colour of the aloe \\\\ \\nit ought to be inferred, that the air cannot alter a quality \\nwhich it communicates itfelf j and we may therefore con¬ \\nclude, that we have difcovered in the aloe one of the mofi; \\ndurable colours known in nature. \\nXIII. 4 \\n', 'r 59 i \\nXIII* A curfory View ofJoin? late JD fcoverics and Improvements \\nin different Branches of Science.

Lagrange has finifhed a very important \\nwork, which he began feveral years ago, entitled, \"The Theory \\nof the Analytical Functions, CSV. in which he (hews that \\nevery thing hitherto called the differential calculus, whe¬ \\nther one follows the method of Leibnitz or that of Newton, \\nmay be reduced to the ordinary calculation of finite quan¬ \\ntities. \\nAstronomy. Herfchel, who has paid great attention to \\nthe fpots of the fun, confiders that luminary as fimilar to the \\nplanets, and not a flaming body. It contains mountains, \\nfome of which he fuppofes to be 200 leagues in height. Its \\natmofphere is compofed of different elaftic fluids, fome of \\nwhich are luminous or phofphoiic, and others only trans¬ \\nparent. The former make the fun appear like a mafs of \\nlight or fire; but the parts of that atmofphere which are \\nonly tranfparent, fuffer his body to be feen. Thefe are the \\nfpots. He believes the fun to be inhabited like the other \\nplanets. \\' \\nLalande, on the other hand, thinks that the fun is really \\na folid body, but that his furface and part of his mafs are \\ncompofed of an incandefeent fluid. This fluid, by any move* \\nment, leaves uncovered fometimes a portion of the body of \\nthe fun or his mountains, and thefe are the fpots. Wilfon \\nconfiders the fpots of the fun as eruptions or volcanoes. \\nShroeter has (hown that in Venus there are very high \\nmountains, as is the cafe on the earth and in the moon. \\nThe greater part of thefe mountains in Venus, like thofe of \\nthe \\n/ \\n', '6© View of fome late Difcoveries and Improvements \\nthe moon, are in the fouthern part of that planet, while oit \\nthe earth the greater part of the mountains are towards the \\nnorth. The day in Venus appears to that aftronomer ter be \\n2.3 hours 21 minutes. It differs therefore very little from \\nthe fidereal day of the earth, which is 23 hours 56 minutes \\n4 feconds. \\nThe volcano of the moon has been feen feveral times by \\nfthe naked eye. Caroche faw it at Paris on the fecond of \\nMarch 1797* It exhibited the appearance of a candle juft \\ngoing out. It refembled a brilliant fpot lefs fenfible than the \\ngreateft fatellite of Jupiter, but larger. Its exiftence there¬ \\nfore can no longer be doubted. \\nLa Place has publifhed an excellent memoir on the \\nmovements of the moon. \\nHennert fays that the diurnal movement of the earth \\nmay undergo fome variations *, but that its variations are \\neompenfated in fuch a manner, that they may be confidered \\nas uniform. \\nHerfchel has obferved around Saturn a quintuple belt of \\nfpots. By thefe means he has fliown the length of the day \\n©f that planet, and determined its diurnal rotation, which he \\neftimates at 10 hours 16 minutes 2 feconds. \\nLalande calculated the orbit of the 83d comet to the \\nmonth of December 1793 ; but an 84th comet was feen by \\nBode at Berlin, on the nth of November 1795, near the \\nconftellation of Hercules, ft was feen alfo by Bouvard, at \\nParis, on the 14th of the fame month. It was fmall, had no \\ntail, and was not vifible to the naked eye. Its orbit has been \\ncalculated by Zach. it was in its perihelion on the 14th of \\nDecember at 15 hours 32 feconds mean time at Gotha. Its \\ndiftance then from the fun was 0,22. \\nAn 85th comet was difeovered in Virgo by Olbers, at \\nBremen, who calculated its orbit. \\nAn 86th was difeovered from the obfervatory at Paris, by \\nBouvard, on the 14th of Auguft 1797, at ten o’clock at \\nnight. It was feen next day, at Leipfic, by Rudiger. It was \\nv. < - . feera \\n/ \\n', 'in different Branches of Science* £2 \\nfeen alfo by various aftronomers in other places. It paled \\nthe earth fix times nearer than the fun, which was th^ eaufe \\nof its apparent motion being very rapid. It was fmatl, ap¬ \\npeared only like a faint white fpot, and had no tail. Zach, \\nat Gotha, makes the number of the comets now known to \\nbe 90. \\nOne of the moll difficult labours of aftronomy is what re¬ \\nlates to the liars. Their immenfe number indeed is fufficient \\nto deter any one from the talk of numbering them 5 for \\nthofe which we fee, and we are far from feeing them all, \\nmay be eftimated at more than a hundred millions. Many \\nof thefe it is well known have peculiar motions, fome of \\nwhich are very confiderable. It is to them, however, that \\nwe are obliged to refer all the motions of the fun, the pla¬ \\nnets, and the comets. It is of importance then to endeavour \\nto determine the motions of the liars; and this obje& has \\nat all times engaged the attention of aftronomers. Malke- \\nlyne has determined with the utmoft precifion the pofitkm \\nof 34 liars. Zach has accompliffied the fame thing in re¬ \\ngard to 1200. Lalande, with his nephew and niece, have \\nundertaken a labour far greater, to determine the pofition \\nof more than 40,000 liars, from the arflic pole to the tropic \\nof capricorn. This fublime talk is already very much ad¬ \\nvanced, as the pofitions of 42,700 are already known. \\nHydrostatics.—Venturi has made interefting experi¬ \\nments on the lateral efflux of fluids. He fliews that the \\nefflux is more confiderable, when a pipe, rather a little long, \\nis adjufted to the aperture of the veflel, than when there is \\nno pipe, or only one that is Ihort. Thus, when one wilhes \\nto draw wine, the jet will be more confiderable by putting \\na cock into the aperture of the calk, than if there were \\nno cock $ and if the cock be fome inches in length, the \\nquantity that flows out will be greater than if it were very \\nIhort. \\nIt is well known, that when fmall bits of camphor and \\nother fubftances, fuch as the juice of the euphorbium, are \\nplaced upon water, they appear agitated in a very remark¬ \\nable \\n', '62 View of fome late T) if cowries amt Improvements \\nable manner. Romieu afcribed this phenomenon to ele&ri* \\ncity, but Volta has proved that electricity has no connec¬ \\ntion with it. Lichtenberg was of opinion, that camphor, \\nlofing a great deal by evaporation, continually decreafes in \\nbulk, and that thefe fmall fragments of it change their con¬ \\nfiguration, which makes a variation in their refpeCtive at¬ \\ntractions. Volta thinks that the vapours which exhale from \\nthefe bodies ftrike the air and the water with fufficient force \\nto caufe the moleculse, from which thefe vapours are exhaled, \\nto be agitated as above mentioned. \\nBrugnatelli has convinced himfelf that this phenomenon \\ntakes place with all fubftances that contain much eflential \\noil, fuch as the leaves of laurel, fage, thyme, vanilla, the nut¬ \\nmeg-tree, the rhus toxicodendron (the poifon-oak), the rhus \\nvernix (the poifon-afh). He found alfo that fmall bodie9 \\nwhich did not move on the water acquired that property \\nafter being impregnated with eflential oil. A piece of bread, \\nfor example, rubbed againft a piece of lemon-peel and im¬ \\npregnated with eflential oil of lemons, moved, after being \\nplaced upon water a little warm. \\nThefe experiments prove that it is jets of eflential oil \\nthrown out with rapidity from thefe bodies, which make \\nthem move on the water. Thefe jets experience a refiftance \\nfrom the air and the water, as a lighted rocket experiences a \\nrefiftance from the air by which it is made to afcend ; that \\nis to fay, in a direction oppoflte to the jet of the flame. \\nVenturi, who repeated all thefe experiments, made feveral \\nfmall fticks of camphor, which he placed on water, adding to \\nthem a bit of lead by way of ballaft. They all moved as ufual; \\nbut he obferved them become a little fmaller above the fur- \\nface of the water, and at length break in two. This effecf \\nis more fpeedy if the water be a little warm, and is occa* \\nfioned by the continual evaporation of the parts; \\nBotany.—Though the number of plants is fo confider- \\nable, being eftimated at about twenty thoufand, that the molt \\nretentive memory can fcarcely remember their names, the? \\nardour for this branch of fcience does not feem to decreafe* \\n6 La \\n', 'in different Branches of Science. 63 \\nLa Billardiere, v/ho went round the world with d’En- \\ntrecafteaux, brought back with him a valuable collection in \\nevery part of natural hiftory.

In Short, he confiders the oxalic acid given in \\nfmall dofes as the belt remedy.

On a new Acid procured from Animal Sulfances, called the \\nZoonic Acid. By Mr. BERTHOLLET. From the Annales \\nde Chimie, Vol. XXVI. \\nI HE liquid procured by diftillation from animal fub- \\nftances has appeared hitherto to contain only carbonate of \\nammoniac and an oil \\\\ but I have found in it an acid, to \\nwhich I have given the name of the zoonic acid. I obferved \\nO \\nthis acid in the liquid obtained from the gluten of wheat, \\nthe yeaft of beer, bones, and woollen rags, diftilled for the \\npreparation of the muriate of ammoniac. I think myfelf \\ntherefore authorifed to confider it as produced by the diftil¬ \\nlation of all animal fubftances. \\nTo feparate this acid, I mix quicklime with the diftilled \\nliquid after having feparated the oil, and then boil or diftil \\nthe mixture. The carbonate of ammoniac is exhaled j and \\nwhen the. odour ceafes to be {harp (piquant)y I filter, and \\nadd a little quicklime to the liquid, which I boil again, till \\nthe fmell of the ammoniac goes oft entirely. What remains \\nis zoonate of lime, which I filter again. 1 then pour upon \\nit water impregnated with carbonic acid, or I blow into the \\nliquid wfith my mouth, through a tube, in order to precipi¬ \\ntate, by the carbonic acid of the refpired air, the quicklime \\nwhich may be held in folution without being combined. \\nZoonate of lime may therefore be employed to effe£t com¬ \\nbinations by complex affinities *, but to obtain the zoonic \\nacid pure I make ufe of the following procefs : I mix the \\nfolution of zoonate of lime in water, made pretty ftrong \\n[rapirochee) in a tubulated retort with the phofphoric acid \\\\ \\nl then diftil it. The diftillation, as the zoonic acid has \\n’very little volatility, requires a degree of heat nearly equal \\nto that of boiling water. The liquor muft then be made to \\nboil. If two veflels be adapted, one after the other, nothing \\nwill pafs into the fecond. It appears that a part of the acid \\nis destroyed by the action of the heat *, for the liquid which \\nis \\n', 'Memoirs of the late P. Nieuwland, 69 \\nIs In ebullition becomes brown, and grows black at the end \\nof the operation. It may thence be concluded that this \\nacid contains carbon. I have not been able to colledt the \\nother principles which are difengaged during the decom- \\npofition. \\nThe zoonic acid has an odour like that of meat when \\nfrying, and is indeed formed during that procefs. It has an \\nauftere tafte. I have been able, as yet, to make on this acid \\nonly a fmall number of experiments, which exhibited no \\nremarkable property. It gives a ftrong red colour to paper \\ntinged with turnfol, and produces an effervefcence with al¬ \\nkaline carbonates. It did not appear to me to produce with \\nalkaline and earthy bafes falts which cryftallize. It forms a \\nwhite precipitate in a folution of acetite of mercury in wa¬ \\nter, and in that of the nitrate of lead j fo that it has more \\naffinity with the oxyde of mercury than the acetous acid, \\nand with the oxyde of lead than the nitric acid. It a£ts \\non the nitrate of filver only by complex affinity *, and the pre¬ \\ncipitate it then forms grows brown with time, which (hews \\nthat this precipitate contains hydrogen. The zoonate of \\npotafh calcined did not form pruffiate of iron with a folution \\nof that metal. A liquid, which had all the indications of \\nacidity, feparated from flefh which I kept a long time in a \\n{fate of putrefaction, but it was an ammoniacal fait with \\nexcefs of acid : this acid combined with lime appeared to me \\nlike zoonate of lime ; but I had too little of it to eftablifh \\nexactly its identity with the zoonic acid. \\nXVI. Biographical Memoirs of the late PETER NlEUWLAND. \\nFrom his Eloge read at jhnferdamy Nov. 24s *794$ \\nSociety Felix Meritis. \\nPeter Nieuwland, profeffior of mathematics and natural \\nphilofophy in the univerfity of Leyden, was born at Diemer- \\nF 3 meer, \\n', 'jo Biographical Memoirs \\nmcer, a village near Amfterdam, on the 5th of November \\n1764. His father, by trade a carpenter, having a great fond- \\nnefs for books, and being tolerably well verfed in the mathe¬ \\nmatics, inftru&ed his fon himfelf till he attained to his \\neleventh year. Young Nieuwland appears to have difplayed \\nflrong marks of genius at a very early period. When about \\nthe age of three, his mother put into his hands fome prints by \\nJohn Luiken, which had fifty verfes at the bottom of them \\nby way of explanation. Thefe verfes (he read to him aloud, \\nwithout any intention that her fon fliould learn them ; and \\n(lie was much furprifed fome time after to hear him repeat \\nthe whole from memory with the utmoft corre£tnefs, on being \\nonly fhewn the prints. Before he was feven years of age \\nhe had read more than fifty different books, and in fuch a \\nmanner that he could frequently repeat paffages from them \\nboth in profe and in verfe. When about the age of eight, Mr. \\n.Aeneae at Amfterdam,- one of the greatefl calculators of the \\nage, afked him if he could tell the folid content of a wooden \\n(latue of Mercury which flood upon a piece of clock-work. \\nYes,” replied young Nieuwland, u provided you give me a \\nbit of the fame wood of which the flatue was made j for I \\nwill cut a cubic inch out of it, and then compare it with the \\nflatue/* Poems which clifplay the utmoft livelinefs of ima¬ \\ngination, and which he compofed in his tenth year, while \\nwalking or amufing himfelf near his father’s houfe, were, \\nthough written at fo tender an age, received with admiration \\nand inferted in different poetical cohesions. \\nSuch an uncommon genius mufl foon burfl through thofe \\nobftacles which confine it. Bernardus and Jeronimo de \\nBofch, two of the firfl and wealthieft men at Amfterdam, \\nbecame young Nieuwland’s benefa£lors, and contributed very \\nmuch to call fo th his latent talents, and to enable the \\npowers of his mind to expand. He was taken into the \\nhoufe of the former in his eleventh year, and he receive^ \\ndaily inflrudion from the latter for the fpace of four \\nyears. While in this faction he made confiderable pro- \\ngrefs \\n', 'of the late P. Nieuwland. 71 \\ngrefs in the Latin and Greek languages, and he ftudied \\nphilofophy and the mathematics under Wyttenbach. In the \\nyear 1783 he tranflated the two diiTertations of his celebrated \\ninftruCtors, Wyttenbach and de Bofch, on the opinions \\nwhich the ancients entertained of the ftate of the foul after \\ndeath, which had gained the prize of the Teylerian theologi¬ \\ncal fociety. \\nFrom the month of September 1784 to 1785, Nieuwland \\nrefided at Leyden as a ftudent in the univerfity, and after¬ \\nwards applied with great diligence, at Amflerdam, to natural \\nphilofophy and every branch of the mathematics, under the \\ndirection of Profeffor van Swinden. In thefe purfuits, in¬ \\ndeed, he had fcarcely any occafion for a mailer ; lor he pof- \\nfeffed the peculiar talent of uniting different fciences, and \\nof comprehending their principles with the utmofl facility. \\nHe had fcarcely begun to turn his attention to chemiftry, \\nwhen he made himfelf matter of the theory of the much- \\nlamented Lavoifier, and could apply it to every phenomenon. \\nHe could read a work through with uncommon quicknefs, \\nand yet retain in his mind the principal part of its contents. \\nNieuwland’s attention was directed to three principal pur¬ \\nfuits : poetry, the pure mathematics, and natural philofophy. \\nIn the latter part of his life he added to thefe alfo aftionomy. \\nAmong the poems which he publifhed, his Orion alone has \\nrendered his name immortal in Holland. Of the fmall ef- \\nfays which he publifhed in his youth, the two following are \\nparticularly deferving of notice : 1. A comparative view of \\nthe value of the different branches of Jcience; and 2. 2\"he lejl \\nmeans to render general> not learning, but foundnefs of judgment \\nand good tafle. \\nOne of his great objeCts was to bring the pure mathema¬ \\ntics nearer to perfection, to amend many faults in them, to \\nclear up and conned their different parts, and in particular \\nto apply them to natural philofophy and aflronomy. Corne¬ \\nlius Douwes difcovered an eafy method of determining the \\nlatitude of a place at fea, not by the meridian altitude of the \\nF 4 fun, \\n', \"72 Biographical Memoirs \\nfun, but by two obfervations made at any other period of the \\nday. This method, however, being Hill imperfedt, Nieuw- \\nland turned his thoughts towards the improvement of it, \\nand in the beginning of the year 1789 wrote a paper on the \\nfubjedt, which he tranfmitted to M. de Lalande at Paris, \\nfrom whom it met with great approbation. In the year \\n1792, when Nieuwland retided two months at Gotha with \\nMajor von Zach, thefe two learned men often converfed on \\nthis method of finding the latitude, and calculated the refult \\nof obfervations which they had made with a fextant and an \\nartificial horizon. The above paper, enlarged by thefe ob- \\nfervations, was inferted by Major von Zach with Nieuw- \\nland’s name in the firit Supplement to Bode's Attronomical \\nAlmanack, Berlin, 1793. \\nThe above, however, was not the only fervice rendered by \\nthis learned man to aftronomy. Newton was the fird philofo- \\npher who fpoke of the mutual attradlion of the heavenly bo¬ \\ndies, and who explained the laws of this attradlion from mathe¬ \\nmatical principles. D’Alembert, Euler, and Clairaut brought \\nHill nearer to perfection what Newton had not fufiiciently \\nilludrated, and defcribed the motion of the moon, the mu¬ \\ntual effedt which the planets have on each other, the per¬ \\nturbations that mud thence be produced in their courfes \\nand the periods of their revolutions, and alfo the laws to \\nwhich thefe perturbations are fubjedt. There however dill \\nremained to be explained fome irregularities in the pheno¬ \\nmena of the planets, and that flow variation which takes \\nplace in the inclination of the ecliptic. De la Place alfo \\nmade fome very accurate calculations on this fubjedf. All \\nthefe great men adopted a truth, which they knew only \\nfrom obfervations, that the axes of the planets do not Hand \\nperpendicular, but inclined to the plane of their orbits. The \\naxis of the earth, for example, makes with the plane of its \\norbit, that is, with the ecliptic, an angle of almod fixty-fix \\ndegrees and a half, and this inclination alone produces the \\nfeafons ; whereas, if the axis of the earth flood perpendicular, \\nwe \\n\", 'of the late P. Nieuwland. 73 \\nwe fhould continually have the fame feafon, and the days \\nand the nights always equal. The caufe, however, of this \\ninclination was dill unknown to all the great aftronomers. \\nDu Sejour fays, in his analytical treatife on the apparent \\nmotion of the heavenly bodies, that it is highly probable that \\nthis phenomenon depends on fome phylical caufe *, but he \\ndoes not venture to mention it. Nieuwland proceeded far¬ \\nther. He laid down principles from which he drew this \\nconclufion, that the above phenomenon is intimately con- \\nnedled with the whole fyflem of attraction. On thefe prin¬ \\nciples he made calculations, the refult of which was exadtly \\nequal to the angle of the inclination of the earth’s axis to \\nthe plane of its orbit. Nieuwland communicated his difco- \\nvery with much modefty to the celebrated ProfelTor Damen \\nat Leyden, who propofed fome objections to it which dis¬ \\ncouraged Nieuwland, and induced him to revife his calcula¬ \\ntions with more accuracy. Major von Zach transmitted the \\npaper which contained them to M. De la Place at Paris, and \\ncaufed it to be printed alfo, for the opinion of the learned, \\nin the Supplement to Profeffor Bode’s Agronomical Alma¬ \\nnack for the year 1793* \\nNieuwland’s talents and diligence foon recommended him \\nto the notice of his country. When in his twenty-fecond \\nyear, he was appointed a member of the commiffion chofen \\nby the College of Admiralty at Amfterdam for determining \\nthe longitude and improving marine charts. On this labour \\nhe was employed eight years, and undertook alfo to prepare \\na nautical almanack, and to calculate the neceflary tables* \\nThe mathematical part was in general entrufted to Nieuw¬ \\nland ; but he aflifted alfo his two colleagues van Swinden and \\nvan Keulen, in the departments afligned to them, with fuch \\naffiduity, that molt of the work publifhed on the longitude, \\ntogether with the three additional parts, were the fruits of \\nhis labour. In the fecond edition of the explanation of the \\nnautical almanack, he had alfo the principal fhare, and he \\nWas the author, in particular, of the explanation of the equa¬ \\ntion \\n', \"Biographical Memoirs \\ntion of time, the method of determining the going of a time- \\npiece* and of calculating the declination of the moon. \\nSoon after Nieuwland engaged in this employment it ap¬ \\npeared as if his deftination was about to be changed. In \\nthe year 1787 he was chofen by the States of Utrecht to fuc- \\nceed Profeifor Heimert j but on account of certain circum- \\nftances this appointment did not take place. He was how¬ \\never invited to Amfterdam by the magiftrates of that city, \\nto give letftures on the mathematics, aftronomy, and naviga¬ \\ntion. While in this fituation he wrote bis ufeful and excel¬ \\nlent treatife on navigation, the fir ft part of which was pub¬ \\nlished at Amfterdam in 1793, by George Hulft van Keulen ; \\nand it is much to be wifhed that M. van Swinden would \\ncomplete this work from the papers bequeathed to him by \\nIns deceafed friend the author. \\nIn aftronomical purfuits, Nieuwland applied not only to \\nthe theoretical but alfo to the pradtical part $ and in this \\nfludy he was encouraged and aflifted by Major von Zach, \\nwith whom he redded fome time in the courfe of the year \\n1792, after the death of his wife, and who inftrudled him in \\nthe proper ufe of the fextant. This affedlionate friend pub¬ \\nlished alfo all his obfervations and calculations in the before- \\nmentioned Supplement to Bode's Aftronomical Almanack. \\nIn the year 1789 Nieuwland was chofen member of a \\nlearned fociety whofe object was chemical experiments \\\\ and \\nfo apt was his genius for acquiring knowledge, that in a \\nlittle time he made himfelf completely mafter of the theory \\nof chemiftry. A proof of this is the treatife which he read \\non the 24th of May 1791, in the fociety diftinguifned by the \\nmotto of Felix Mentis, and which has been printed in the \\nfir ft part of the New General Magazine (Nienv Algemeen \\nMagazyn). At the fame time he was able to examine the \\nimportant difcoveries made by the fociety, to aftift in pre¬ \\nparing an account of them for the prefs, and to publifh them \\nwith fuffifcient accuracy in the French language. Three \\nparts of this work appeared under the title of Recherches \\n\", \"of the late P. Nieuwland. 7^ \\nPhyfico-chymiques. The fir ft part appeared in 1792, and wa» \\nafterwards re-printed in the Journalde Phyfique. The fecond \\nwas publifhed in 1793, and the fourth in 1794. Some let¬ \\nters ofhis on chemiftry may be found alfo in the MeiTenger \\n(Letterbode) \\nThis ingenious and diligent man was of great fervice alfo \\nin the philofophical department to the above fociety, Felix \\nMentis, of which he was chofen a titular member on the \\n25th of January 1788, and an honorary member on the \\n15th of March 1791. The papers for which it was indebted \\nto him are as follows —1. On the newefi difcoveries in afiro- \\ntiomy, and the progrefs lately made in that fcience, 1788.

Nieinvland, \\nmade confiderable improvements in nautical charts, and \\nfilled up his vacant hours with the fludy of philofophy and \\nchemiftry. In the month of July 1793 he was invited to \\nthe univerfity of Leyden, to be Profeflbr of Philofophy, \\nAftronomy, and the Higher Mathematics, in the room of \\nthe celebrated Damen ; and the Admiralty of Amfterdam \\nrequeiled him to continue his nautical refearehes, which he \\ndid with great afliduity till the period of his death. The \\nonly variation which he now made in his ftudies related to \\nnatural philofophy, for with the mathematics he was already \\nfufficiently acquainted. He applied therefore to the experi¬ \\nmental part, and fpared no pains nor labour to become perfedh \\nin it; which would certainly have been the cafe, had he not \\nbeen fnatched from fcience and his friends at the early age \\nof thirty. He died of an inflammation in his throat, accom¬ \\npanied with a fever, on the 13th of November 1794* \\n- In his external appearance, Nieuwland was not what might \\nbe called handfome, nor had he ever paid much attention to \\nacquire that eafe of deportment which diftinguiihes thofe \\nwho have frequented polite company. His behaviour and \\necnverfation were however agreeable, becaufe he could dif- \\ncourfe with facility on fo many fubjects, and never wifhed \\nto appear but under his real character.

M. Muller of Reichenftein had, fo early \\nas 1782* fufpecied that this ore contained*a peculiar metallic \\nfubftance, and his fufpiclon was confirmed by Bergman, to \\nwhom he had lent fome of the ore j but on account of the \\nfmall quantity with which he had made his experiments he \\nwould not venture to decide, whether it contained a new \\n* This ore is found in the mine called Mariahilf in the Fatzbay moun* \\ntains near Zalethna in Tranfyivania.

The repeated and \\ningenious experiments made by M. Klaproth on a more con~ \\n{iderable quantity of the ore, which had been tranfmitted to \\nhim by M. de Reichenftein, fully confirmed the conjectures \\nof the latter as well as thofe of Bergman. \\nProcefs for obtaining the Metalfrom the Ore. \\n1. The ore is gently heated with fix parts of the muriatic \\nacid \\\\ three parts of the nitric acid being then added, the \\nmixture is boiled •, upon which there arifes a very confiderabie \\neffervefcence, and a complete folution is obtained. \\n2. The filtered folution is diluted with as much water as \\nit can bear without becoming turbid, which is a very fmall \\nquantity, and a folution of caufiic potalh is then added to \\nthe liquor, until the white precipitate which is at firft formed \\ndifappears again, and nothing remains but a brown flaky \\nfediment. \\n3. This laid precipitate is the oxyde of gold mixed with the \\noxyde of iron, and a fcparatlon is effected by the common \\nmeans. \\n4. The muriatic acid is added to the alkaline folution (2) \\nin fuificient quantity to faturate the alkali entirely : an ex« \\ncefs of the acid mult be avoided. A white precipitate, \\nwhich, by heat, fettles at the bottom of the veflel under the \\nform of a heavy powder, is produced in great abundance. \\nAfter the precipitate has been walhed and dried, it is formed \\ninto a kind of pafte with a fufficient quantity of any fat oil j \\nand this mafs is put into a fmall glafs retort, to which a re¬ \\ncipient is flightly fitted. When this arrangement is made, \\nit is gradually brought to a red heat; and in proportion as the \\noil is decompofed, there are obferved, as in the diftillation of \\nmercury, brilliant and metallic drops which cover the upper \\npart of the retort, and which, at intervals, fall to the bottom \\nof the veflel, and are immediately replaced by others. After \\nit has cooled, metallic fixed drops are found adhering to the \\nTides of the retort and at the bottom of the veflel, and the \\nTemaind^r \\n', \"So On a new Metal called Tellurium. \\nremainder of the metal reduced and melted with a brilliant \\nfurface, and almofl always cryflalhzed. \\nEffential charaElerifmg Marks of this new Metal• \\n1. It has the white colour of tin, approaching to the grey \\ncolour of lead. Its metallic fplendour is confiderable, and \\nits fradture laminated. It is highly brittle and friable. By \\nfuffering it to cool quietly and gradually, it readily afiumes a \\ncryflallifed furface. \\n2. Its fpecilic gravity is 6.115. \\n3. It belongs to the clafs of the moll fufible metals. \\n4. When heated by the blow-pipe upon charcoal, it burns \\nwith a very lively flame of a blue colour, inclining at the \\nedges to green. It is fo volatile as to rife entirely in a whitifh \\ngrey fmoke, and exhales a difagreeable odour like that of \\nradifhes. On ceafing to heat it, without having entirely \\nvolatilifed the final! portion fubjedled to this operation, the \\nbutton which remained, 1 stained for a long time its liquidity, \\nand, by cooling, was covered with a radiated vegetation. \\n5. This metal amalgamates eafily with mercury. \\n6. With fulphur it forms a grey fulphure of a radiated \\nftrudlure. \\n7. A folution of it in the nitric acid is transparent and \\ncolourlefs. When concentrated, it produces, in time, fmall \\nwhite light cryftals, in the form of needles, which exhibit a \\ndendritic aggregation. \\n8. The new metal diflolves in the nitro-muriatic acid. \\nWhen a large quantity of water is added to fuch a faturated \\nfolution, the metal is precipitated in the hate of an oxyde, \\nunder the form of a white powder, which, in this (late, is \\nfoluble in the muriatic acid. \\n9. By mixing cold, in a well-flopped veffel, a fmall quan¬ \\ntity of this metal with a hundred times its weight of con¬ \\ncentrated fulphuric acid, the latter gradually aflumes a beau¬ \\ntiful crimfon red colour. By means of a fmall quantity of \\nwater added, drop by drop,' the colour difappears, and the \\n\", 'O/i cl new Metal called Telluriums gl \\nfmall quantity of the metal diflolved, depofits itfelf under \\nthe form of black flakes. Heat deftroys the folution: it \\nmakes the red colour difappear, and difpofes the metal to fe. \\nparate in the ftate of a white oxyde. \\n10. When, on the other hand, the concentrated fulphuric \\nacm is diluted with two or three parts of water, and a fmall \\nquantity of the nitric acid has been added, a confiderable \\nquantity of the metal will then be diflolved. The folution \\nis transparent and colourlefs, and is not decompofed by the \\nmixture of a larger quantity of water. \\nn- All the pure alkalis precipitate from acid folutions of \\nthis metal an oxyde, of a white colour, foluble in all acids ; \\nby an e.xcefs of alkali, the precipitate which is formed is en¬ \\ntirely re-diffolved. If carbonate be employed inftead of pure \\nalkali, the fame phenomenon takes place—with this differ¬ \\nence, however, that, by excefs of the latter, the precipitate \\nformed is re-diflblved only in part. \\n12. Exceedingly pure prufliate of potafli produces no \\nprecipitate in folutions of this metal. \\n13. Alkaline fulphures mixed with acid folutions occa- \\nfion a brown or blackifli precipitate, according as the metal \\nis combined with more or lefs oxygen. It fometimes hap¬ \\npens that the colour of the precipitate has a perfeft refem- \\nblance to mineral kermes, or red fulphurated oxyde of an- \\ntimony. \\nWhen the fulphure of tellurium is expofed on burning \\ncharcoal, the metal burns with a blue colour conjointly with \\nthe fulphur. \\n14. The infufion of gall-nuts^ combined with the fams \\nfolutions,, gives birth to a flaky precipitate of an Ifabella \\ncolour. \\n15* Iron and zinc precipitate tellurium from its acid fo« \\nlutions in a metallic hate, under the form of fmall black \\nflakes^, which refume their fplendour by fri&iom, and which, \\non burning charcoal,, melt into a metallic button, \\nVol, L Q \\n16 9 Tin \\n', '3% Oh a new Metal called Tellurium. \\n16. Tin and antimony produce the fame phenomenon- \\nwith the acid folutions of the new metal. \\n- The precipitate foTmed by the antimony proves,, in a ftrik¬ \\ning manner, that tellurium is not a difguifed antimony, as \\nhas been ftippofed. A folution of tin in the muriatic acid, \\nmixed with a folution of tellurium in the fame acid, pro-’ \\nduced alfo a black and metallic precipitate. \\n17. The oxyde of tellurium, obtained from acid folu¬ \\ntions by alkalis, or from alkaline folutions by acids, are both \\nreduced with a rapidity refembling detonation, when they \\nare expofed to heat on charcoal. It bums, and.is volatilifed, \\nas has been already mentioned. \\n18. By heating tor fome time this oxyde of tellurium in. \\na retort, it melts, and appears, after cooling, with a yellow \\nftraw colour, having acquired a fort of radiated texture. \\nT9.

From a late \\nFrench Journal. \\nnp _ _ \\nA TIE place for their reception had been long prepared. \\nIt is a fpacious hall in the Mufeurh of Natural Hiftory, well \\naired and lighted. A ftOve is placed in it to warm it during \\nthe winter, and it is divided into two apartments, which \\nhave a communication with each other by means of a large \\ndoor refembling a portcullis. The enclofure round thefe \\napartments confifts of rails made of fcrong thick beams, and \\na fecond enclofure, bread-high, runs round them, to keep \\nthe fpeclatOrs at fome diftailce, arid preferve them from ac¬ \\ncidents. \\nThe morning after their arrival thefe animals were put \\nin poffeffion of their new habitation. The firft conducted \\nto it was the male, who iffued from his cage with precau¬ \\ntion, and feemed to enter his apartment with a degree of \\nfufpicion. His hrft care was to reconnoitre the place. He \\nexamined each bar with his trunk, and tried tlieir folidity \\nby (baking them. Care had been taken to place on the out- \\n(ide the large fcrews by which they are held together. Thefe \\nhe fought out, and, having found them, tried to turn them, \\nbut was not able. When he arrived at the portcullis, which \\nfeparates the two apartments, he obferved that it was fixed \\nonly by an iron bar, which rofe in a perpendicular direction, \\nlie raifed it with his trunk, puihed up the door, and entered \\n-into the fecond apartment, where he received his breakfaft. \\nHe ate it quietly, and appeared to be perfectly eafy. \\nDuring this time people were endeavouring to make the \\nfemale enter. We hill rccolledt the mutual attachment of \\nthefe two animals, and with what difficulty they were parted, \\nand induced to travel feparately. From the time of their de¬ \\nparture they had not feen each other' not even at Cambray, \\nwhere they paffed the winter. They had only been fenfible \\nthat they were near neighbours. The male never lay down, \\nO % but \\n\", '84 On the Elephants brought to Paris. \\nbut always flood upright or leaned againft the bars of his \\ncage, and kept watch for his female, who lay down and llept \\nevery night. On the lead noife, or the fmalleft alarm, he \\nfent forth a cry to give notice to his companion. \\nThe joy which they experienced on feeing each other after \\nfo long a reparation may be readily imagined. \\nWhen the female entered, fhe fent forth a cry expreffive \\nonly of the pleafure which die felt on finding herfelf at li¬ \\nberty. She did not at fird obferve the male, who was bufy \\nfeeding in the fecond apartment. The latter alfo did not im¬ \\nmediately difcover that his companion was fo near him ; but \\nthe keeper having called him, he turned round, and imme¬ \\ndiately the two animals rufhed towards each other, and fent \\nforth cries of joy fo animated and loud, that they fhook the \\nwhole hall. They breathed alfo through their trunks with \\nfuch violence, that the blafl refembled an impetuous gud of \\nwind. The joy of the female was the mod lively : die ex¬ \\nploded it, by quickly dapping her ears, which die made to \\nmove with adonifhing velocity, and drew her trunk over the \\nbody of the male with the utmod tendernefs. She, in parti¬ \\ncular, applied it to his ear, where die kept it a longtime, and, \\nafter having drawn it over the whole body of the male, \\nwould often move it affectionately towards her own mouth. \\nThe male did the fame thing over the body of the female, \\nbut his joy was more concentrated.

Some Particulars refpe&ing the late Dmhaffy of the \\nDutch Eajl India Company to the Court of Pekin, \\nCitizen M. L. E. Moreau de Saint Mery has lately \\npublilhed, at Paris, an extract from Van BraairPs Journal of \\nthe Embalfy of the Dutch Eaft India Company to the Em¬ \\nperor of China, in the years 1794 and 1795, one volume \\nquarto, being the fir ft. The fecond, accompanied with maps \\nand engravings, is announced as about to appear. \\nThe principal objedt of thofe who give an account of their \\ntravels to the public, ought to be to make known the ufages, \\n-public and private manners, the legislation, arts, induftry, \\nprodudfions, the temperature, commerce, religion, and go¬ \\nvernment of thofe countries which they traverfe. \\nThofe of Citizen Van Braam have not been written accord¬ \\ning to this fyftem ; nor indeed could they, for the members \\nof the embalfy were hardly fuffered to have any kind of in- \\ntercourfe with the natives. His work,' as the title announces, \\nis only a journal, containing an account of the different places \\nthrough which the author palled in going from Canton to \\nPekin, and returning by the fame route. \\nIf this Journal, which feems to have been written only for \\nthe private fatisfadfion of the author, does not give an extent \\nlive and profound knowledge of China, it contains, at any \\nrate, feveral details which may be ufeful to thofe who wifh \\nto colledt information .refpedting this lingular and interefting \\ncountry. \\nThere are three ways of travelling in China. By water, in \\n■veflcls called yachts; by land, in palankins carried by men \\ncalled coulis, or in fmail carriages made like wheel-barrows. \\nThe eftablifhment of poking, and fufpended carriages, are \\nG 3 unknown \\n\", '85 \\nDutch Dmhajjy to China. \\nunknown in that country. The horfe, the moft beautiful \\nand ufeful animal in Europe, is defpifed there. Buffaloes, \\nmules, and dromedaries, are the animals principally employed \\nfor tranfportation. \\nIn no country does agriculture flourifh fo much as in China. \\nThis art is there beheld with almod religious veneration. \\nOn this fubjebl there are treatifes, brought to perfection by \\napplication and the experience of feveral ages : thefe treatifes, \\nfuited to the foil of each canton, are depofited in the hands \\nof the mandarin who abts as fird magidrate 5 and he takes \\ncare that the neighbouring farmers {hall be made acquainted \\nwith, and turn to advantage, the leffons which thefe treatifes \\ncontain. \\nCitizen van Braam fpeaks of the monuments which he \\nfrequently met with on his route, and which he charablerifes \\nunder the name of triumphal arches, and oblagonal or hexa¬ \\ngonal towers confiding of feven or eight dories. He does \\nnot explain the ufe of thefe towers, which appear to be in \\nChina what obelifks were among the Egyptians. \\nW ith regard to the triumphal arches. Citizen van Braam \\nfays that they are monuments creeled to the memory of \\nwarriors who rendered fervices to their country, and fome- \\ntimes to private citizens who fignalifed themfelves by their \\nvirtues. Some have been erebled alfo to young women and \\nwives : to the former on account of their chadity, and to the \\nlatter on account of their fidelity. \\nIf perpetual virginity could be made to accord with nature, \\nit would be no great merit in China to devote one’s felf to \\nit; for the manner in which women are there treated, is not \\nmuch calculated to awaken in young perfons of that fex a \\ndefire of being chade. Parents carry on a kind of traffic \\nwith their children. Thole who are faid to be of good birth \\ngive them in exchange for a large dowry, which they put \\ninto their own pockets: ethers fell them like merchandife, \\nwithout caring what becomes of them. The wives of the \\nrich live in perpetual confinement 5 thofe of the fecoml \\norder \\n', \"Dutch Dmhajfy to China, 87 \\norder are the fervants of their huflbands; and thofe of the \\nlower elafs of the people are forced to take a (hare in the \\nfevere labour of the men, who treat them as we treat thofe \\nanimals which aflift us. \\nThe emperor is revered as a god. The power of the \\nfovereign and of a high-pried: are both united in his perfon. \\nThe fame homage is paid to the edicts which he iflues, the \\ndifpatches which he figns, and the prefents which come \\nfrom him, as are paid to himfelf. That is to fay, the people \\nproftrate themfelves before a piece of paper, or filk, as they \\ndo when they are in his prefence. The embafladors were \\nfeveral times obliged to make ridiculous falutations before \\nthe remains of bad proviflons, or paftry, which the emperor \\nhad fent them from his table as a mark of particular con- \\nfideration and favour. \\nThe court of Pekin prefents nothing ftriking. The moft \\nremarkable object is the wall by which it is furrounded. All \\nthe apartments are narrow and mean, and confufion prevails \\nin all the ceremonies, which are conduced without any \\norder whatever. \\nThe entertainments to which the embafladors were invited, \\nconfided of a few breakfafts where the emperor was prefent. \\nSome boiled meat, confe&ions, paftry, a beverage called \\nfamfon, and another called bean-milk, ferved up on tables \\naround which the guefts fquatted down upon cuihions, \\nformed the chief articles at thefe morning collations. \\nIt appears that the people of China'make very bad cheer. \\nThe want of the pleaiures of the table is not fupplied by \\nothers. The Chinefe fpehtacles confift only of a few feats \\nof tumbling, and extemporary farces. And thefe fpeftacles \\neven are not public. They are exhibited only in the interior \\npart of the palace, and in the houfes of fome of the chief \\nmandarins. \\nIn this country there is no focial communication among \\nthe inhabitants, who live inlulated and confined to their \\nown homes. \\nG 4 Though \\n\", \"$8 Dutch 'Embajjy to China* \\nThough the embafifadors remained more than a month \\nat Pekin* Citizen van Braam fays nothing of the manners* \\ncommerce* or monuments of that city. This will not appear \\naflonifhing* when it is known that the members of the em- \\nbaffy* like thofe which preceded them from England* were \\nconfined to their hotel* as if they had been in prifon ; \\nthat they were narrowly watched; that the letters which \\nthey fent to fome miffionaries of their acquaintance were \\ninfpe&ed at the poll-office; and that they never went out \\nin order to go to court* at three or four o’clock in the morn¬ \\ning in the middle of winter* without being cfcorted by con¬ \\nductors.

From Crell’s Chemical \\nArmais for 1797. \\nOf all the fubftances I have tried, liquor of flint is that \\nwhich, after a feries of experiments, appears to me to be the \\nmoil mcombuftible, and the moft proper to fecure paper \\nfrom deftru&ion by fire. I dipped the fheet of paper feveral \\ntimes in the above liquor, frefli made, or, I daubed it feveral \\ntimes over the whole paper with a hair brufli, and dried it in \\n| the fun or in an oven. Paper prepared in this manner loll \\nfome of its foftnefs, became a little rougher than before, and \\nacquired a lixivious cauftic tafle. In other refpe&s it was \\nnot different from common white paper. When this paper \\nwas laid upon glowing coals, it did not bum like common \\npaper, out became red, and was converted to a coal, which \\nhowevei did not fall into allies like the coal of common \\npapei, fo that it might therefore be conftdered as petrified \\npapei. This coal, however, is exceedingly friable; for, \\nwhen it is taken between the fingers, or prefled together in \\nany manner whatever, it drops to pieces. \\nAs the chemifts confider incombuflibility as one of the \\npiincipal characleriftics of faline fubftances, I made experi¬ \\nments with different kinds of falts, to try whether they \\nwould render paper incombuftible, like this liquid filiceous \\npotafti, which is not a fait, but a combination confuting ©f \\ntwo fubftances. \\nI took feveral fbeets of common white writing-paper, and \\ndipped each of them, in the fame manner as I had proceeded \\nwith the above liquor of flint, in a particular fait, and ob- \\nierved how the different leaves withftood the fire when \\nthrown into it.

Hep ort made to the Council of the Mines in Spam re- \\nfpedting anew Wood properfor Dyeing, called Paraguatan. \\nBy D. Dominic Garcia Fernandez, InfpeBor of the \\nMint. From the Annales de Chimie. \\nIn compliance with the orders of the Supreme Council of \\nCommerce and the Mines, I undertook a chemical examina¬ \\ntion of a wood known in Guiana under the name of Para¬ \\nguatan. This examination I carried to fuch a length as I \\nthought neceflary for acquiring a knowledge of its nature, \\nand of the advantages that may be derived from it in dyeing. \\nI obferved in the firft place that the bark, the wood properly \\nfo called, and the leaves of the paraguatan produce different \\ncolours. The leaves, however, do not merit much attention, \\nas they communicate only a fading and not very agreeable \\ncolour. My refearches have, therefore, been dire died chiefly \\nto the bark, as that part is the moft important, and my obfer- \\nyations \\n', 'Account of a new Wood for Dyeing. 93 \\nnations refpe&ing the bark may be applied alfo to the wood ; \\nfor, though the latter produces a different colour, it exhibits- \\naimoft the fame phenomena as the bark. \\nIf the bark be boiled in water, the coloured extract thence \\nrefulting, when expofed to the adlion of the fulphuric, muri¬ \\natic and nitric acids, refills them much longer than an ex- \\ntrad! of brafil or logwood. The colour, after being deftroyed \\nby a combination of acids, may be revived by the means of \\nalkalis. \\nVinegar, lemon-juice, and tartar render this dye more \\nbrilliant, and communicate to it a fine rofe colour, while \\nthefe acids, on the other hand, deftroy the colour of brafil \\nand logwood altogether. \\nThe feculse of the bark of the paraguatan attach them- \\nfelves and adhere to woollen, cotton, and filk. The colour \\nis more brilliant on filk than woollen, and more brilliant on \\nthe latter than on cotton. \\nThe fame feculse dried may be afterwards diffolved in \\nalcohol, and communicate to it a tint fimilar to that obtained \\nfrom cochineal. \\nBy mixing alum with a highly concentrated decodlion of \\nthe fame fubftance a fpecies of lake may be produced, but \\nneither fo lively nor fo pretty as that obtained from cochi¬ \\nneal by a like procefs. \\nThe fame decodfion mixed with that of gall-nuts furnifh- \\ned me with a precipitated pigment of a weak rofe-colour. An \\ninfufion of brafil or logwood, mixed with an infufion of \\ngalls, affumes a darker and browner tint; mine on the other \\nhand became clearer by it, and aftumed a delicate rofe colour, \\nor one fomewhat fimilar. \\nIt muft indeed be acknowledged, that the dye extracted \\nfrom the paraguatan has not a ftrength equal to that of co¬ \\nchineal. It is however fuperior to thofe of madder, brafil \\nand logwood, fince it refills vinegar, lemon-juice and tartar. \\nSoap even does not deftroy it fo fpeedily as it does thofe of \\nbrafil and logwood. \\nThe bark is attended with this advantage, that by employing \\nit \\n', \"^4 Acchunt of a new Wood fir 'Dyeing. \\n• * * * \\nit in certain quantities, and giving a fuitable preparation to filky \\nwc by thclc means may produce the various (hades of rofe and \\npoppy colour, which can be produced only by the carthamus \\nor lafflower with alkaline mixtures, litter a difficult proeefs* \\ntedious wa filings, and other embarraffimg manipulations. \\nBy examining the external form of a piece of the paragua- \\ntan, it appears to me to be the fame tree as that which Francis \\nCorreal fays he obferved in the province of Popayan*, which \\nis not far from Guiana. The fame author relates that this \\ntree is different from that of Brazil 5 that the trunk, which \\nis the fize of one’s thigh, is thirty or forty-feet in height ; \\nthat its bark is full of longitudinal grooves • that the wood \\nwhen ftripped of its bark is of a beautiful red; and that the \\nIndians employ the wood mixed with a red earth to dye the \\ncotton which they ufe for dreffies. \\nThe colour extracted from the paraguatan does not refill the \\nadlion of light: no colour indeed can ftand that ted. This \\ncolour, however, will ftand much longer than that of bra¬ \\nid or logwood; but, on the other hand, thefe two trees fur a \\nnidi colouring matter in greater abundance. \\nI confider the paraguatan, therefore, as one of thofe valu¬ \\nable productions which America fiirniihcsto Spain. It may \\nbe employed with advantage in the art of dyeing throughout \\nall Europe. It is to be wifhed that fearch may be made \\nfor it in Popayan, and that fame of the earth mentioned by \\nCorreal may be fent over to us. The governor of Guiana \\nought alfo to collect every information poiiible that may re¬ \\nlate to the paraguatan, and to tranfmit it to us, as well aS \\nother fpeciniens of the woocl, with fomc of its leaves and \\nflowers, in order that its fpecies may be determined. \\nA knowledge^ of this wood begins to be extended., as I \\nlately received a portion of its hark and of a red fab franco', \\nwhich were brought from Guiana by an Englifhman named \\nMilnes It is to be prefumed that this fubftance is the fam6 \\nas that mentioned by Correal in his voyages. \\n* Voyages aux Indes.Occidentals, 1722, p. 420, \\nINTEL- \\n\", \"[ 9.5 1 \\nINTELLIGENCE, \\nLEARNED SOCIETIES. \\nFRANCE. \\nPrizes prcpQjl’d by .the 'National Ivftitute, in the Sitting of \\nGerminal i 5, [April Atb, 1798.) \\nFIRST PRIZE. \\nV ...

In 1793, fifty \\nyoung plants were carried from Otaheite by Captain Blight \\nThey were then from 6 inches to 3 feet high. They are \\nnow 30 feet and upwards, and the circumference of the hems \\nfrom 3 to 3^ feet. \\nIt was feared, when they were firft carried over, that they \\nwould not have ftrength to hand ap'ainft the violent hum- \\ncanes of the Weft Indies; but the wood is found, on the \\ncontrary, to be extremely tough, and well qualified to refill \\nthe fevereft gufts of wind.. \\nThe bread-fruit weighs from 4 to lolbs. each, and is in \\nits greateft perfection about a week before it is quite ripe. \\nWhen baked, which is the beft method of cooking it, it is \\n«qual, if not fuperior, to bread. From its firft appearance, \\nit is three months before it is fit for eating. \\nThe trees are propagated by fuckers, which a rife in abun¬ \\ndance. \\ni \\nThe Society alfo received fome bifeuit made from the \\nfruit, which they agreed was an excellent fuccedaneum for \\nbread. \\nSome curious experiments, which promife important bene¬ \\nfits to mankind, have lately been made by Sir Francis Ford, \\nto determine whether oxygene, or vital air, has any effeffs \\nupon vegetation different from common atmofpheric air. \\nHe found by repeated trials, that flowers, and other plants, \\nfprinkled with water that had been previoufty impregnated \\n\\\\vith oxygene gas, grew much more vigoroufty, and even dif- \\nplayed more beautiful tints than fimilar plants on the fame \\nground treated with common water.

In 1756 the \\nking of France iffued an eclidl, exempting from land-tax \\nfor the fpace of 20 years (that is to fay, in all fields newly \\nbroken up) all cultivators of madder in drained marfhes and \\nother wafte and negle&ed grounds. In 1763 the Board of \\nAgriculture held at Beauvais made it plain to all perfons \\nconcerned in dyeing, that madder railed in that diftridt, and \\nufed while the roots were frefh gathered, gave a finer tinc¬ \\nture than the Zealand madder, and went further in the pro¬ \\nportion of eight to five. In the fame year it was ordered in \\ncouncil, that no tax, for the fpace of 20 years, fliould be \\nlevied upon grounds newly broken up, provided the faid \\ngrounds had lain 20 years in an uncultivated ftate.

A \\nfmall hexagonal cabin of the like diameter, and 7 \\\\ feet in \\nheight, forms the moveable upper part of the whole build- \\ning, to which is affixed the mechanifrn that ferves for the \\n# \\nmotion of the telefcope. \\nThrough the middle of the fmall cabin arifes a very \\nftrong axle b b, the upper part of which b may be feen pro- \\njefting above the flat top of the cabin.

A fmall vertical cylinder ff proceeds along the fide \\nof the cabin down to the horizontal wheel, and at the lower \\nend has an eighteen inch wheel g with twelve teeth, which \\nfit into thofe of the large wheel. The Imall wheel, to de¬ \\nfend it from the injuries of the weather, is inclofed in a \\n\" box. To the top of this fmall cylinder, which rifes three \\nfeet above the platform, is affixed a crofs-bar lever x x, and \\nthe cylinder has its point of motion in a collar at h, in which \\nfmall rollers are applied to leflen the effects of fridtion. By \\nturning the crofs the whole cabin moves round its axis, and \\nthe tube of the telefcope 11, connected with it, is thus made \\nto move alfo horizontally. The vertical movement of the \\ntube, which was attended with confiderable difficulty, is \\neffected in the following manner: At the end of the beams \\nhk, which project parallel to each other, on a level with the \\nupper frame of the building, afife the inclined beams mmny \\njoined to the former by mortices at o, and morticed alfo at \\nbottom into the uprights of the cabin. They are fupported \\nby ftrong braces, and, where neceffary, are bound faff: with \\niron fcrews. To prevent all lateral agitation, Profeflor \\nSchrader placed at right angles on the two horizontal beams \\nk k, and fattened to the cabin, another beam H of fufficient \\nflrength, each end of which projects five feet over the \\nbeams k k. From thefe ends arife two oblique beams r% and \\n5 z, each of which is morticed as at z, a foot and a half below- \\nthe bridle //, and bound alfo with iron. \\nv The mechanifm of the movement of the tube between \\nthis hanging frame-work is fimilar to that of HerfcheFs \\ntelefcope. Along the interior part of each fide of the frame¬ \\nwork, from 7i to /, is a groove (reprefented in the plate by \\npricked lines), and a ftrong oblong rectangular frame moves \\nin this groove by means of four fmall iron rollers fixed \\nto the corners with fcrews. By the crofs lines vv the \\nplace \\n', \"Account of the Telefcope at Kiel. v lij \\nplace of the frame only is marked. In this frame the tube is \\nmade to move on a ftrong roller. At the upper end of the \\nfraihe is fufpended one box of a tackle of fix pulleys, the \\nfecond box of which is facetted,to the crofs beam 11 of the \\nhanging frame-work, and the rope Ip, proceeding from'the \\ntackle, is wound round the cylinder of a horizontal windlafs, \\nthe handle of which is in part vifible at tt. The fecond \\nrefting-place of the tube is in a fork on the top of an iron \\nrack y, by which the more accurate movement both vertical \\nand horizontal is effected with the greateft eafe* When \\nthe handle tt is turned round, the hiding frame together \\nwith the tube rifes or falls, and a common fpring catch ap¬ \\nplied to the windlafs keeps the tube in that pofition to which \\nit has been brought. To counteract the weight of the \\ntube, which increafes according to the perpendicularity of \\nits pofition, the Profeffor fattened to the end of it a fmali \\ntackle, the rope of which, carried over a pulley fixed to \\nthe crofs beam //, fuftains a re-a6ting weight of igo pounds. \\nThis weight a£ts only from the perpendicular fituation of \\n| the tube to about that in which it is reprefented in the plate* \\nThe quick horizontal movement, which is effected by means \\nof the crofs-bar lever with the cylinder and horizontal wheel, \\nrequires a power of about forty pounds; fo that the obferver \\ncan, with great eafe, turn the tube round the whole hori¬ \\nzon, though the weight of the conft ruCtion taken together \\namounts to about 12,000 pounds. \\nFrom comparing this defcription with the figure in the \\nannexed plate, it will be feen that the gravity, both on ac¬ \\ncount of the weight of the hanging frame-work and that \\nof the tube, mutt incline too much to one fide: it was \\nfound neceffary, therefore, immediately after it was con- \\nftruCfed, to devife the following counterpoife: The two \\nhorizontal beams G G, a foot fquare, which fupport the gal¬ \\nlery FF, with the ladder that conducts to the platform, \\nwere made to projeCt on a level with the bottom part of the \\ncabin.

The fmall balcony con¬ \\ntains a feven-feet telefcope ten inches in diameter* which \\nthe Profeffor differs always to remain in the open air, and \\nufes as a hand telefcope. For the greater fecurity, a drong \\niron rod, concealed by the wainfcoting in the inhde, is con¬ \\nveyed along the door and to the top of the cabin. Ihe \\nlower extremity of this rod ends in two branches fcrewed to \\nthe door, and the upper part rifes one foot above the plat¬ \\nform. On the top of it is duck the key which ferves for \\nmoving ft; and by lefs than half a turn of this fcrew, the ob~ \\nfcrver is enabled to prevent all agitation of the building, be- \\ncaufe the rod then preffes with force againd the furface of \\nthe horizontal wheel. Properly, however, there are three \\nfcrews, forming an equilateral triangle,, which effedl this \\nfadenmg, two ol which in the cabin are very fhort, and \\nthe whole are fo arranged, that it is neceffary to move the \\nlong drew only on the platform.

From the Tranfadtions of the \\nBatavian Society in the Ifland of Java for promoting the \\nArts and Sciences, Vol. IIL \\nJi HESE fmall birds are of a blackilh grey colour, in¬ \\nclining a little to green ; but on the back to the tail, as \\nwell as on the belly, this blackifh colour gradually changes \\ninto a moufe colour. The whole length of the bird from \\nthe bill to the tail is about four inches and a half, and its \\nheight from the bill to the extremity of the middle toe three \\ninches and a quarter. The diftanc.e from the tip of the one \\nwing to that of the other, when extended, is ten inches and \\na quarter. The largeft feathers of the wings are about four \\ninches in length. The head is flat; but, on account of the \\nthicknefs of the feathers, appears round, and to be of a large \\nfize in proportion to the reft of the body. The bill is \\nbroad, and ends in a (harp extremity, bent downwards in \\nthe form of an awl. The width of it is increafed by a naked \\npiece of {kin fomewhat like parchment, which, when the \\nbill is {hut, lies folded together, but which, when the bill \\nopens, is confiderably expended, and enables the bird to catch \\nwith greater eafe, while on wing, the infecfts that ferve it \\nfor food. The eyes are black, and of a confiderable fize. \\nThe tongue, which is not forked, is ftiaped like an arrow. \\nThe ears are flat, round, naked fpots, with fmall oblong \\nopenings, and are entirely concealed under the feathers of \\nth§ \\nI \\n', 'T \\n/ - which conftrudts eatable Nejls. 119 \\nthe head. The neck is very fhort, as well as the legs and \\nthe bones of the wings. The thighs are wholly covered \\nwith feathers; and the very tender lower parts of the legs, \\nand the feet thermelves, are covered with a fkin like black \\nparchment. Each foot has four toes, three of which are \\nbefore and one turned backwards. They are all detached \\nfrom each other to the roots; and the middle one,, together \\nwith the claw, is fully as long as the lower part of the leg. \\nEach toe is furnilhed with a black, (harp, crooked claw of a \\nconfiderable length, by which the animal can with great \\nfacility attach itfelf to crags and rocks. The tail is fully as \\n. long as the body together with the neck and, the head. \\nWhen expanded it has the form of a wedge, and confifts of \\nten large feathers. The four firft on each fide are long, and, \\nwhen the tail is clofed, extend almoft an inch beyond the \\nreft. The other feathers decreafe towards the middle of the \\ntail, and are equal to about the length of the body. \\nThe whole bird is exceedingly light and tender. Ten of \\nthem to,o-ether weighed little more than two ounces and a \\nhalf. The Javanefe call it lawit; but thofe who live in the \\nmountains, berongdagce or waled*. \\nThere are two places in particular near Batavia where \\nthefe birds are found in great numbers. rihe firft, Calappa \\nNongal, lies about ten miles fouthwards from the city; the \\nother, Sampia, is a- little more diftant towards the fouth- \\nweft; but they are both in that range of high land extending \\ntowards the fea, which is apparently difterent from the large \\nridge that extends over the whole iftand. Beftdes thefe there \\nare alfo feveral other places in the fame diftridt, or at a \\ngreater diftance from the coaft, which either produce a lew, \\nor are carefully concealed by the Javanefe to whom they are \\nknown. \\nThe two bird mountains before mentioned, called by the \\nJavanefe caverns (goa), are infulated rocks, hollow within, \\n* Voerong in the Malay language ftgnifies in general a bird. \\n14 and \\n', 'iso Account of the Javanefe Swallow, \\nand pierced with a great number of openings. Many of \\nthefe openings are fo wide, that a perfon can enter them \\nwith eafe; others are attended with more difficulty; and fome \\nof them are fo finally that nature evidently feems to have been \\ndefirous of providing for the fecurity of thefe little animals. \\nOn the outfide thefe rocks are covered with a multitude of \\nffrong tall trees of various kinds. The infide confifts of grey \\ncalcareous ftone and white marble. To th® walls of thefe \\ncaverns the birds .affix their fmall nefts in horizontal rows, \\nand fo clofe that they for the molt part adhere together. \\nThey conftrudt them at different heights from 50 to 300 \\nfeet; fometimes higher or lower, according as they find \\nroom; and no hole or convenient place, if dry and clean, is \\nleft unoccupied; but if the walls be in the leaf: wet or moift \\nthey immediately defert them. \\nAt day-break thefe birds fly abroad from their holes with \\na loud fluttering noife, and in the dry feafons rife fo high \\ninto the atmofphere in a moment, as they muff feek their \\nfood in diftant parts, that they are foon out of fight. In the \\nrainy feafon, on the other hand, they never remove to a great \\ndiftance from their holes, as has been often remarked, parti¬ \\ncularly in the government of Java, where there are fome \\nrocks fituated very clofe to the fhore. About four in the \\n«/ \\nafternoon they again return, and confine themfelves fo \\nclofely to their holes, that none of them are feen any \\nmore flying either out or in, but thofe which are hatch¬ \\ning- \\nThey feed upon all forts of infedfs which hover over the \\nffagnated water; and thefe they eafily catch, as they can ex¬ \\ntend their bills to a great width. Their mo ft deftrublive \\nenemy is a kind of hawk {knikendief), which feizes many of \\nthem as they iffue from their holes; and which people, on \\nthat account, take great care to frighten away by fhooting \\nat them. \\nThey prepare their nefts from the ftrongeft remains of \\nthe food which they ufe, and not of the fcum of the fea or \\nof \\n', 'which conJlruFis eatable Nejls. i$i \\nof fea plants*, as has been afferted. This feems the more \\nprobable, as it is known, from experience, that thofe birds \\nwhich build their nefts in the two rocks before mentioned \\nhave never been found on the fea-coaft, and could not pof- \\nfibly fly thither and return again in fofew hours, on account \\nof the high intervening mountains, and the ftormy winds \\nthat often prevail among them. The great difference in the \\ncolour and value of thefe nefts proves that their goodnefs \\ndepends merely on the fuperabundance and quality of the \\ninfers on which they feed, and perhaps on the greater or \\nlefs folitude of the place where they feek for nourifhment. \\nThofe found on the territory of Calappa Nongal and Goa~ \\ngadja are exceedingly grey, and worth one third lefs than, \\nthofe produced in the territory of Sampia; and the latter \\nagain are not to be compared with an excellent fort which \\nare every year Imported from Ternate and Paffier, or which \\nare to be found on the furrounding iftands, particularly to \\nthe eaft of Borneo. \\nThefe birds employ two months in preparing their nefts; \\nthey then lay their eggs, on which they fit for fifteen or \\nfixteen days. As foon as the young are fledged, people \\nbegin to collect the nefts, which is done regularly every \\nfour months : and this forms the harveft of the proprietors \\nof thefe rocks. \\nThe bufinefs of taking down the nefts is performed by \\nmen acduftomed from their youth to climb thefe rocks. \\nThey conftru£t ladders of reeds (bofchrotting) and bamboos, \\nby which they are enabled to afcend to the holes; but, if the \\ncaverns are too deep, they employ fhip-ropes. When they \\nhave got to the bottom of the caverns, they place bamboos \\nwith notches in them agamft the wall, if thefe be fufficient \\n* This has been hitherto generally believed, and copied from one \\nnaturalift by another.

For this reafon, fmall watch-houfes are every¬ \\nwhere built in the neighbourhood. \\nThe mountaineers, who are thofe chiefly accuftomed to \\nthis employment, never undertake their labour till they have \\nSlaughtered a buffalo, which is the ufual preparation made \\nby the Javanefe for all their undertakings. On fuch oc¬ \\ncasions they mutter over a few prayers, anoint themfelves \\nwith aromatic oils, and fumigate the holes with fweet-fmell- \\nIng fubftances, which, according to their ideas, are things \\nall highly neceffary. At the chief of thefe caverns in the \\nIftand of Java, a particular protecting female deity is wor¬ \\nshipped under the name of Eaton Laut Ridul, or princefs of \\nthe fouth fea. A fmall hut with a covered fleeping-place is \\nthere appropriated for her, together with various elegant \\n- articles of clrefs, which no one but a princefs muft approach ; \\nand every Friday when the nefts are taken down incenfe is \\ncontinually burnt, and the body and clothes of every one \\nwho intends to afcend the rocks muft be expofed to it. The \\nother Javanefe are not fo fuperftitious, and content them¬ \\nfelves with much fewer ceremonies. To afford them lioiit \\nD \\nin the cavern, they employ torches made of the refinous \\ngum of a large tree called caret, and the inner bark of the \\narek-tree. \\nThe collecting of the nefts continues mo longer than a \\nmonth, and, as already mentioned, may be repeated three \\ntimes in the year. Some believe that it may be done a \\nfourth \\n\", '* which conJlruBs eatable Nejls„ 123 \\nfourth time 5 hut this is not probable, as all experienced \\npeople brought up to this employment confidently aflert, \\nthat a neft as long as it remains entire is continually enlarged \\nby the bird, or made thicker, until it is entirely deferted by \\nher when it has become dry or hairy in the infide. \\nWhen the nefts have been collected, no farther trouble \\nis neceffary than to dry them and clean them, after which \\nthey are put in bafkets and fold to the Chinefe. The price of \\nthem is variable, and depends on their whitenefs arid fine- \\nnefs. Some of them have a grey, and others a reddifh ap¬ \\npearance.. Tliofe of the belt fort are exceedingly fcarce. \\nThey are fold at the rate of from Soo to 1400 rix-dollars per \\nJ \\n123 pounds. This high price, and the infatiable avarice of \\nthe Chinefe, give rife to much difhonefty and thieving; \\nefpecially as the Chinefe make no ceremony of bribing the \\nwatchmen with money, opium and cloth; and tins, even \\nwith the utrnoft vigilance, cannot be entirely prevented. \\nThe two places above mentioned, Calappa Nongal and \\nSampia, belonged formerly to the Dutch Eaft India company; \\nbut as the advantages arifing from them weie m pait much \\nleffened by the Javanefe, and in part not well underftood, \\ngovernment refolved, m the year 17 70 > 1° them by \\nauction to the higheft bidder, and received for them almoft \\na hundred thoufand rix-dollars, afum far exceeding what was \\ngenerally expeaed. Befides thefe, there are feveral other \\nplaces of the like kind, in the above range of mountains, \\nthough of lefs importance. There are two or three alfo in \\nthe high land in the interior parts of the country, and feve¬ \\nral fmall ones which are kept concealed with great care. Three \\nconfiderable bird mountains, Goa Daher, Cede, and Nanga- \\nfari, are fituated in the government of Samarang in Java 5 \\nand thefe are wafhed by the fea, which forces its way fo deep \\ninto the latter, that fifh may be caught in it. In thefe places \\nthe nefts are of an excellent quality ; but it is exceedingly \\ndangerous to collect them on account of the fteepnefs of the \\nr rocks \\n', '13-4 Account of the Javanefe Swallow, \\nrocks and the violence of the furf, and therefore a fufpended \\napparatus made of bamboos muft be employed. \\nAbout 3500 pounds weight of thefe nefts are colledled \\nevery year in the ifland of Java. \\nThere are bird caverns alfo in Bantam and the ifland of \\nSumatra ; but the inhabitants of the former are fo indolent, \\nand the government fo bad, that rice even is not fown, nor \\nis any other article neceffary for the fupport of life culti¬ \\nvated. The Chinefe have never ventured to penetrate into \\nthe interior part of that kingdom, and have no intercourfe \\nwith the mountaineers ; fo that little can be expedite from \\nthat quarter. \\nThe young birds are eaten both by the Javanefe and the \\nEuropeans in India, but it is difficult to procure them. \\nThey are confidered to be very heating. The nefts, on the \\nother hand, when they have been boiled to a flimy kind of \\nfoup, expofed in the night-time to the dew, and been mixed \\nwith fugar, are exceedingly cooling. The Javanefe employ \\nthem therefore, with much advantage, in violent fevers. \\nThe author of this paper faw alfo that, when prepared as \\nabove, they were prefcribed with good fuccefs for fore throats \\nand hoarfenefs. This remedy, in all probability, has been \\nborrowed from the Chinefe, who, as a rich merchant of that \\nnation who carried on a great trade with thefe nefts allured \\nthe author, eat abundance of them during the winter, be- \\ncaufe fore throats are then very common in the northern \\npart of that extenfive kingdom, on account of people fitting \\nfo much over the fire. \\nBut this noun filing and ftrengthening quality, fo much \\nextolled, the author was not able to difcover, though he ufed \\na confiderable number of thefe nefts, prepared different \\nways, in order to be convinced of the truth. He caufed \\nthem to be examined by able chemifts; but nothing more \\ncould be ooferved, than that the folution prefented a weak \\ngum \\n', 'vJbich conjlru&s eatable Nejls, 12$ \\ngum with a difagreeable tafte, which perhaps might be of \\nfome ufe in flight indifpofltions of the breaft. \\nThefe-nefts, therefore, are merely an article of luxury to \\nornament the tables of the rich. The Chinefe are remark¬ \\nably fond of them. After being foaked and well cleaned, \\nthey put them, along with a fat capon or a duck, into an \\nearthen pot clofely covered, and fuffer them to boil for \\ntwenty-four hours over a flow fire, which they call timmen% \\nand on account of this addition the whole difh acquires a \\nmore lufcious tafte. \\nThe trade carried on with thefe nefts was fome years ago \\nnot fo confiderable, but of late it has much increafed. The \\nhigh price of them in China, which is ftill advancing, makes \\nBatavia the principal mart of this commodity., which, as the \\ncompany have now given it up, is employed very advantage- \\noufly by the inhabitants to lefien the prejudicial exportation \\nof fpecie. \\nThat this fpeeies of fwallow is not to be found in China \\nis now fufficiently known. \\nLinnaeus in his SjyJl. Nat. gives, as a diftinguifhing mark \\nof the Hirundo efculenta, that it has white fpots only on the \\nfeathers of the tail. The fmall birds in Java, however, \\nwhich conftrudt thefe nefts, have fpots neither on the tail \\nnor on any other place. The tail feathers are entirely ol \\none colour, blackifh grey above, and a little brighter below. \\nRumph fays of his capodes marines, that the feathers of the \\ntail were fpotted, and that the breaft alfo was fpeckled black \\nand white. \\nValentin, in his defcription of the fmall fwallow which \\nconftru&s eatable nefts, mentions neither fpots nor fpeckles, \\nand fays only that the belly was undulated white and black. \\nIf thefe are to be confidered as eflential differences, it will \\nfollow that there are two kinds of thefe fwallows: one with \\na fpeckled breaft and white fpots on the tail feathers, and \\nthe other without fpots or fpeckles. A third kind of thefe \\nfwallows would be thofe called movm or boerongilams. Thefe \\n', 'I2f5 Procefs followed at Afracan \\nalfo prepare their nefts of eatable fubfiances, but, on account \\nof the number of fmall feathers and other impurities mixed \\nwith them, are not fit to be ufed.

After the \\nfirft boiling the fire is flackencd, and the dye is fuffered to \\nhand over a gentle heat, while it is continually ftirred round : \\nthis is continued even after the furnace is cooled, till a thick \\nfcum arifes in the neck of each jar, and foon after difappears. \\n.

The blue dyer lays this \\nyarn to fteep in pure water, preffes out the fuperfluous water \\nwith the hands, and then immediately begins to dip it in. \\nthe blue jar, often wringing it till it is completely penetrated \\nby the dye. This firft tint is generally given to yarn in fuch \\njars as have had their colouring matter partly exhaufted.

The procefs is as follows: The \\nyarn is firft boiled for an hour in a ftrong ley of foda; it is \\nthen dried, afterwards rinfed and laid wet to fteep for twelve \\nhours in a folution of alum with warm water. When it has \\nbeen dried in the air, it is laid to foak feveral times in \\ntroughs with the dye which has been boiled thick in kettles \\nfrom the above-mentioned plants, till it has acquired the \\nwifhed-for colour, care being; taken to drv it each time it is \\nfoaked. It is then rinfed in running water, and dried for \\nthe laft time. \\nOn this yellow colour a green is often dyed. After the \\nyarn has been dyed yellow, it is given out to the blue dyer, \\nwho immediately dips it in the blue jars, the dye of which, \\nhas been already partly exhaufted ; and if the green colour \\n. is not then fufftciently high, the operation is repeated, the \\nyam being dried each time. \\nIV. Oh- \\n\", \"[ 128 ] \\n/ \\nI \\nIV. ObJ'ervations on a Junction of the Red Sea to the Ivleditef \\nranean. From the Journal de Phyftque for 1798. \\nIt is needlefs to attempt to prove of how much import¬ \\nance it would be to form a junction between the Red Sea \\nand the Mediterranean. Every one is fenlible that it might \\nproduce invaluable advantages in regard to the civilifation of \\nAlia and Africa ; the reciprocal commerce both between \\nthefe two parts of the worlds and between them and the \\nwhole of Europe; and particularly in regard to France; \\nefpecially when it {hall have joined the Mediterranean to \\nthe German fca, as I propofed in 1786* when I publiftied \\nThe Junction of the Rhone with the Rhine. \\nIt would be ufelefs alfo to examine every thing that has \\nbeen faid by ancient hiftorians, refpeCting the great works \\nthat may have been executed, or only undertaken, for that \\npurpofe, by the kings and other Sovereigns or governors of \\nEgypt, from Sefoftris or Pfammeticus down to Trajan or \\nAdrian, fmce no traces or certain defcriptions of them \\nare remaining;; and fince fo many efforts made fo often, \\nand in fuch various ways, from time immemorial, only \\nferve to prove the great importance that has always been \\nattached to this enterprise, even when it could have been \\nattended only with a local or very limited utility in compa¬ \\nrison of what it holds out at prefent. \\nIt is however certain, that an able engineer, by examining \\nthe country with attention, would there difcover remains \\nfufficient to convey juft ideas refpeCting the vague and con¬ \\ntradictory accounts of the fttuation, the direction, entrance, \\nand exit of thefe Several canals. But all this would be of \\nlittle benefit. He would doubtlefs perceive, that if fome or a \\npart of thefe works have been effaced or deftroyed by the \\nhand of time, or abandoned on account of wars, or through \\nthe policy or inftability of governments, none of them were \\nplanned or executed in fuch a manner as to anfwer fully the \\n, end \\n\", \"£)# a Junction of the Hcd Sea unth the J^lediterranean* 129 \\nend that ought to be propofed at prefenC They cannot, \\ntherefore, be a (Turned as models or helps for any new work, \\not the fame kind ; which, however, as will here be feen, \\ncould be executed with much eafe and finiphcity, fuppofing \\nthe undertakers had entire and peaceable poffeffion of the \\nifthmus and weftern coaft of the Arabic gulph, as well as \\nof the courfe of the Nile, and all the intermediate country \\nadvancing a great way towards the fouth. \\nithout giving credit to a pretended higher level of the \\nRed Sea than of the Mediterranean, which is not pro¬ \\nbable, we mull, according to the account of all travellers, \\nadmit there periodical tides and accidental elevations, \\namounting from five to fifteen feet $ and this is fufficient to \\nprevent every plan of a communication between thefe two \\nfeas, conftru&ed on a perfect level, and always navigable \\nfor the larged vends, fince an influx of waves fo great \\nwould ravage it from the one end to the other, and certainly \\nbe followed by an ebbing fo low as to render the Mediterra¬ \\nnean higher and deftru&ive in its turn. But what would \\noblige the undertakers to renounce this talk is the impofli- \\nbility of digging a long and continued bed, to the depth of \\ntwenty feet below the level of the two adjacent feas, in a \\ndiftrid: which no doubt rifes much more above that level \\nand which is faid to confift entirely of hills and dowiis of ex¬ \\nceedingly moveable fand, where the- conftru&ion &nd pre¬ \\nservation of a canal would be like the labour of Penelope. \\nWe muft not, therefore, think of joining thefe two feas but \\nby a river navigation for barks or boats drawing fix or eight \\nfeet of water at moft, and between two ports, fuch as Suez \\non the one fide and Grand Cairo, Toftat or Boulac on the \\nother, which feem to have been deftrhed for that purpofe, \\nfince their direct diftance is only twenty-five leagues, and \\nfince the eaftern branch of the Nile below Cairo is as deep \\nas the fea itfelf at Damictta, Zan, &c. \\nBut it is necefiary not only to give the new canal the lead \\nlength, but alfo the fmalleft elevation poffible. But accord- \\nVoL* r* , K ' ing \\n\", '1^0 On a Jun&ion of the \"Red Sea \\ning to ifeveiy account, the nature of the ground will oppofe \\nthe full execution of thefe two objects, and feems to fhow \\nthat they might thwart each other. The only method \\nthen is to weigh them both together, taking matters even in \\nthe worft light; and to determine the queftion I propofe \\nthe following preliminary confiderations : \\n1. The leaft elevation which the canal ought to have \\nfrom one end to another, fhould be equal to that of the \\n•Treated: tides or fvvellings of which the Red Sea is fufeeptibie. \\nThe level of the canal would be thus fixed, and all the dif¬ \\nferences from the high eft to the loweft riling of ,tne fea \\nwould be counteracted by one or two locks, as it might be \\npoffible to counteract at the other end all the overflowings \\nof the Nile, which probably rife higher, and which in that \\ncafe would require flood-gates. \\n2. There are two other methods which might be adopted \\nin the like cafe, but which would he far lefts advantageous. \\nOne of thefe, which would fave the neceftity of locks both \\ntowards the fea and towards the Nile, is, not to allow boats \\nor other veflels to come from or enter the fea but twice a day \\nat the times of the tides, and not to come from or enter the \\nNile but when it is at its greateft heights. . But this would \\nlay too great a reftraint on commerce, particularly at Cairo, \\nwhere the tranfportation of goods would not be poffible but \\nduring; two or three months : but ftill the level Would be- \\ncome doubtful and variable, like all tides and inundations ; \\nand there would neceflarily be alternate currents, which \\nwould render the water brackiffi and unhealthful, not only \\nin the canal, but alfo in the Lower Nile. \\n3. The other method, in order to exclude locks altogether, \\nor at leaft in part, would be, to deprefs more the bed and \\nlevel of the canal, taking care to guard it at each end by the \\nflood-gates, which would permit veflels to enter the fea or \\nthe river at the times of their greateft elevation. But, though \\nthis method might render the courfe of the navigation freer \\nand left interrupted, it would not prevent the mixture of the \\nv freftx \\n', '13I \\nwith the Mediterranean, \\nfrerti and fait waters. It would fave nothing either in con-, \\nflru(Sting or the labour of managing the locks: in fhort, it \\nwould mcreafe in a prodigious degree the folid content of \\nthe excavations and the general expence of the works. \\n4* The fmalleft elevation which the caiial ought to have \\nwould be fixed then by the greateft height of °the waters \\neither of the fea or the river. But in fuch an extent it is \\nprobable that feveral eminences might oppofe this general \\nlevel; and even in carrying the canal round thefe the labour \\nwould undoubtedly be increafed. In fhort, it would be im- \\npoffible to avoid the neceflity of making the canal begin on a \\nj ndSe or eminence; by which means it would defcend by \\n: tv\\\\o inclined planes, one on the eaft towards the fea, and \\nthe other on the weft towards the Nile. \\n5* In that cafe the queftion would be, to determine the \\nmaximum and the place of the elevation, which could be \\ndone only after a long examination of the fpot, and an exadt \\nfurvey of the higheft part of the ground, by means of le¬ \\nvelling. The eflential objedl of this examination will be, \\ni ♦ ,1 ° avoid both the fands which are to the north, and the \\nrocks or mountains that abound in the fouth. 3. To find \\non the ridge of the latter that fpot which would correfpond \\nheft with the following conditions, viz. that the canal might \\nbe rendered as fhort and as little expofed to windings as pof- \\nftble; and that its point of departure fhould be fo low that \\n\\\\effels might afcend to it by the feweft poliiblc number of \\nlocks, and yet give occafion to as little digging as pofiible* \\n3* And as thefe three conditions will often be unattainable \\nat the fame time, to balance them, and to make them reci¬ \\nprocally give way and prevail in fuch a manner that the me~ \\ndium may eniure the moil advantageous refult in the greateft \\nnumber of refpects. \\n6. Having thus determined the fummit or higheft point of \\ndeparture, with the length and depth of the canal, we may \\neafily find, and without any doubt, the means of filling it, \\nK 4 and \\n', '*3* On a Jun&ion of the Tied Sea \\nand of feeding it abundantly by the waters of the Nile., by \\ngoing up the river beyond Cairo as far as the fpot where its \\ngeneral height is greater than the level already fixed, and \\nfrom which it will be neceffary to draw off on the right bank \\na large ftream or branch of water, defended by ftrong gates \\nagain ft muddy water or extraordinary inundations, and to \\nconduct it gradually in an inclination of fifteen or eighteen \\nlines in a hundred fathoms, and to make it end by the \\nfhorteft paffage towards the weftern extremity of the pomf \\nof departure. This, however, fuppofes that the mountains \\niituated to the eaft cannot fupply water in fufficient abund¬ \\nance and by a lhorter paffage, which would be extremely der- \\nftrable, and which ought to be carefully examined; for it \\nappears certain that the Nile has very little inclination below \\nits cataracts, which are nearly two hundred leagues from \\nCairo ; and confequently the place where the water is drawn \\noff ought to be taken at a fufficient diftance to be higher \\nthan the point of departure of the canal, however little it \\nmay have been eftablilhed above the level of the higheft \\ntides and inundations. \\n7. According to the beft and lateft defcriptions of that \\ncountry, we may however believe that this point of departure \\nwill neither require deep excavation below the furface of the \\nground, nor a great elevation above the mouths of the canal* \\neither at the Nile or the Red Sea; for it appears certain on \\nthe one hand, that the laft of ail the ancient canals, that \\nafcribedto Amron the Arabian, was dug in a perfect level,- \\nand even open from one end to the other, proceeding from* \\nthe Nile to Foftat; and on the other, that an ordinary rife of \\n16 cubits will be fufficient that the river may enter there at \\nprefent, for a length of four leagues, traverfing Grand \\nCairo. There is no reafon then to doubt that this rife \\nwould proceed to the Red Sea, and would there makeTome \\nfall, if the remains of the canal had not been filled up either \\nby the hand of time, or by wars between thofe nations fepa- \\nrated by the Adriatic, \\n8. It \\n', 'zuith the Mediterranean. 133 \\n8. It is probable then that this grand communication might \\nbe re-eftablifhed by fimplc cleaniing or by Tome amendment, \\nbut with fluices and other neceffiary works at both the mouths, \\nthat navigation might at all times be there poffible, what¬ \\never might be the variable height of the waters in the river \\nand the fea; the latter of which, notwithftandmg what has \\nbeen laid on the fubjecl, will be found conftantly lower than \\nthe former even at the time of the higheft tides. The high- \\neft rilings of the Nile, -therefore, which at Foftat are laid to \\nbe from 20 to 22 cubits, muft determine the general level \\nof the canal, that is to fay, the height of the locks needfary \\nto defeend towards each of its extremities when tire waters \\nare at their loweft, and alio the diftance and height of .the \\nplace from which the water of the Upper Nile muft be \\ndrawn oft* to feed this canal, coalting aiong the Hope of \\nthe mountain as far as the northern cape or promontory of \\nMokattan, or from a bafon railed about thirty feet above \\nGrand Cairo. It would alio be attended with the valuable \\nadvantage of fountains and great embellishments to that city, \\nbecome the central mart or repofitory of the ancient world. \\nBeftdes, it would be a powerful prefervative againft infalli¬ \\nbility and that contagion which fo frequently afflid that im- \\nmenfe city, on account of the drought and exccffive filthi- \\nnefs which prevail there, \\nIt maybe readily feen, then, that this plan does not prefent \\nnearly fo many phyftcal difficulties,, and is not fuch an ini- \\nmenfe enterprife as fome have imagined ; ftnee the diftance \\neither from Cairo to Suez, or to Colzoum, or to any other \\nport more to the fouth or more convenient, does not exceed \\n25 leagues’ for that of Suez feems difficult, and to be \\nthreatened with being fpeedily choked up at the point of \\nthe gulph which is the narroweft, and which becomes \\nnarrower every day—a new reafon for abandoning a canal, \\nthough perhaps the fhorteft, which ffiould proceed diredly \\nirpiri Suez to the Mediterranean, particularly when we coim \\nMvr the impoffibility of conducting fo far, and amidft fuch \\nK 3 » foil \\n', \"134 Experiments and Obfcrvations \\n-a foil, a {beam from the Nile, which however would be in- \\ndifpenfibly neceffary to feed it, fince it ought not, and even \\ncould not be dug to the bottom, or to the level of the two \\nfeas. \\nThere is however one important remark ftill to be made, \\nwhich is, that the prefent trade of Egypt with AfiaSs carried \\non merely by caravans, and by two different ways; one en¬ \\ntirely over land acrofs the ifthmus and fands for 30 or 60 \\nleagues, even to Syria; and another by a defile among the \\nmountains of Upper Egypt, for 25 or 30 leagues only, from \\nCophtos to Cofeir, which is a port of the Red Sea much \\neaiier of accefs than Suez, becaufe the fea there is broader \\nand much lefis dangerous. But as this defile feems to be \\nfavourable to a canal, which might be fed equally well and \\nwith more eafe from the Upper Nile, and as that river is \\nnavigable to Cophtos as well as to Grand Cairo, there is \\nevery appearance that a canal in the latter lituation, planned \\nwith the fame care, would be more fure as well as more ad¬ \\nvantageous to the nation that might have the fovereign pof- \\nfeffion of Upper as well as Lower Egypt, efpecially as it is \\nabfolutely neceffary that it fhould be fufficiently powerful to \\nfubdue the Bedouins, who infeft the whole country, and \\nwho would foon render the canal of Cairo as impradticable \\nas that of Cophtos, \\nV.

He let loofe feveral birds in a chamber per- \\nfedly dark, and perceived that the bats flew about in it' \\nwithout any impediment, and neither ruflied againft any \\nthing in the apartment, nor touched the wails with their \\nwings. He at firth imagined that they were conducted \\nby fome glimpfe of light which he did not perceive, and on \\nthat account he blindfolded them with a fmall and very \\nclofe hood. They then ceafed to fly; but he obferved at \\nthe fame time, that this did not proceed from any depriva¬ \\ntion of light, but rather from the conftraint thence occa- \\nfioned, efpecially when a hood of a very light texture was \\nattended with the fame effect. \\nHe then conceived the idea of pafting up the eyes of the \\nbats with a few drops of flze or guip; but they Hill flew \\nabout in the fame manner as if their eyes had been open. \\nAs this however was not fufficient, he palled up the eyes of \\nthefe animals with round bits of leather, and this even did \\nnot impede them in their flight. \\nThat he might at length be certain of his objeCt, he \\nblinded them entirely, either by burning the cornea with a \\nred hot wire, or by pulling out the pupil with a pair of fmall \\npincers, and fcooping out the eye entirely. Not contented \\neven with this precaution, he covered the wounds with \\npieces of leather, that the light might have no influence \\nwhatever on the remains of the organs which had been de- \\nflroyed. The animals feemed to fuffer very much by this \\ncruel operation; but when they were compelled to ufe their \\nwings, either by day or by night, and even in an apartment \\ntotally dark, they flew perfectly well, and with great caution, \\ntowards the walls, in order to fufpend themfelves when they \\nwifhed to red. They avoided every impediment great or \\nfmall, and flew from one apartment to another, backwards \\nand forwards, through the door by which they were con¬ \\nnected, without touching the frame with their wings.

When the horfe- \\nfhoe bat attaches itfelf to a wall, it contracts its body, and \\nwraps itfelf up in its fur in fach a manner that it might be \\ntaken for a black chryfalide. The long-eared bat appears \\niefs careful of itfelf, and fir ft makes ufe of its hind feet, and \\nthen of thofe before, in order to affix itfelf to a wall. \\nThe temperature of the vaults which ferved them for a \\nhabitation was between 50° and 57° Fahr. that of the exter¬ \\nnal air between 270 and 30k M.

M, Jurine had before, \\nobferved the fame effect on mice. He remarked, however, \\nthat the approach of a candle agitated and awakened them^ \\nprobably on account of the rarcfa&ion of the ambient air, \\nA violent agitation of the air by which they are furrounded \\nmakes them fpeedily take wing. \\nDuring the torpid ftate of thefe animals no movement \\nis obferved which can indicate that they breathe, A fmall \\nhorfe-fhoe hat, a large bat of the fame fpecies_, and a \\nlong-eared bat were placed on a ftove, and exhibited \\nfigns of life at, different periods; but their infpiration \\nand expiration, were extremely irregular, particularly thofe \\nof the long-eared bat. There is a ftriking difference be¬ \\ntween the pofttion of thefe two fpecies of bats when they fix \\nthemfelves againft any objeH. The horfe-fhoe bat hooks it¬ \\nfelf all at once, with its head down and its legs upwards; \\nwhile the long-eared bat turns, itfelf round quietly, in order \\naffume very often an oblique pofition* \\n7 \" ‘ Thr \\n', \"Experiments on Bats deprived of SigVt* \\nThe author then proceeds to the experiments which the \\niliuftrious Spallanzani undertook before, but in which great \\nfcope was ft ill left for the imagination. The author feems to \\nhave found the delideratum which his predeceflbr left for \\nthofe who might follow him in the fa pie path. \\nHe extended in an apartment feveral willow twigs three \\nfeet in length, at the diftance of fix inches from each other, - \\nand let loofe two bats, which palled and repaired between \\nthem, without touching them at all with their wings, and \\nwhich, when their flight was ended, always attached them- \\nlelves to the fame cornice. The author then cut out their \\neyes; during which operation, the long-eared bat fuffered a \\nconllderable hemorrhage from the ocular orbits. Being let \\nloofe in that ftate, they ftill flew to the fame interfaces. \\nThefe being barred up, they made choice of others, through \\nwhich they palled feveral times, always avoiding to touch \\n.the twigs with their wings, and for that purpofe they palfed \\nobliquely. \\n* The long-eared bat fometimes ftretched out its neck, \\nand as it were made choice of that objedf to which it \\nwifhed to attach itfclf; a cuflom which it had before it was \\nblinded. It often applied one of its hind paws to its eye: \\ncollected the liquid which exuded from it, and then applied \\nit with avidity to its mouth. Thefe two bats lived a long \\ntime after they were deprived of fight. Two long-eared bats, \\nthe one blind, and the other having the perfect ufe of its \\nfight, were let loofe together. The blind one always fol- \\n„ lowed, its companion, even obferving the fmalleft linuofities r\\nof its courfe. The bat which faw, palled between the twigs ' \\nwith lefs delicacy than the blind one. \\nM. Jurine then extended a net with large mefli.es, after- \\nmaking a breach in it. The long-eared bat which faw, \\npalled through it immediately; but the blind one flopped ; \\nfhort, -went all over the net, and, having found the breach, \\nf>afled through without touching it, and then foon joined its |\\ncom- \\n\", 'Experiments on Bats deprived of Sight. \\ncompanion, which it afterwards followed wherever it flew. \\nOf what ufe then is fight to the bat, and what is the organ \\nthat fupplies its place ? \\nThe author then imagined that the folution of this pro- \\nblem could be found only by anatomical refearches. During \\nthe courfe of thefe, he found the organ of hearing very great \\nin .proportion to that of other animals, and a confiderable \\nnervous apparatus afligned to that part. The upper jaw alfo \\nis furniflied with very large nerves, which are expanded in a \\ntifliie on the muzzle. \\nM, J urine then extended his experiments to the organ of \\nhearing and that of fmell. Having put a fmall hood on a \\nlong-eared bat, it immediately pulled it off, and flew. He \\nflopped up its ears with cotton, but it freed itfelf in the like \\nmanner from that inconvenience. He then put into its ears \\na maftic of turpentine and wax. During the operation the \\nanimal (hewed a great deal of impatience, and flew after¬ \\nwards very imperfectly. \\nA long-eared bat, the ears of which had been bound up* \\nflew very badly: but this did not arife from any pain occa- \\nfioned by the ligature; for, when its ears were fewed up, it \\nflew exceeding well. In all probability the animal would \\nhave preferred having its ears bound up to having them \\nfewed. Sometimes it flew towards the ceiling, extending its \\nmuzzle before it fettled. \\nM. Jurine poured liquid pomatum into the ears of a bat \\nwhich enjoyed the ufe of its fight. It appeared to be much \\naffeCted by this operation; but when the fubftance was re¬ \\nmoved, it took flight. Its ears were again filled, and its eyes \\nwere taken out; but it flew then only in an irregular man¬ \\nner, without any certain or fixed direction. \\nThe ears of a horfe-flioe bat, which had the ufe of its fight, \\nwere filled with tinder mixed with water. It was uneafy \\nunder the operation, and appeared afterwards reftlefs and \\nftimned; but it conduced itfelf tolerably well. On being \\nblinded, it rufhed with its head againft the ceiling, beat the \\nozier \\n', '14° Experiments on Eats deprived of Sight. \\nozier twigs with its wings, and made the air refound with \\nfirokes which it gave itfeif on the muzzle. This experiment \\nwas repeated on other bats with the like effedls. \\nThe tympanum of a large horfe-fhoe bat was pierced with \\na pin [trots-quart). The animal appeared to buffer much from \\nthe operation, and fell down in a perpendicular direction. 1 \\nwhen thrown into the air. It died next morning. The fame i \\neffedt was produced on piercing the tympanum of a long¬ \\neared bat with a needle. \\nThe author then made very accurate refearches on the dif¬ \\nference between the organifation of the brain of thefe two \\nkinds of bats, and, after a careful cliffection, found that the \\neye of the long-eared bat is much larger than that of the \\nhorfe-fhoe bat, but that the optic nerve is proportioned to it. \\nThe outer part of the ear of the former is much larger than \\nthat of the latter, but the interior part is fmaller. \\nThe horfe-fhoe bat is indemnified for this difference by a \\ngreater extenfion of the organ of fmell, as evidently appears \\nwhen the external elevations and irregularities of its muzzle \\nare examined. When it is about to take flight, it agitates \\nIts nofe much more than the long-eared hat. \\nFrom thefe experiments the author concludes, firff, that \\nthe eyes of the bat are not indifpenfibly neceflary to it for \\nfinding its way; fecondly, that the organ of hearing appears \\nto fupply that of fight in the difeovery of bodies, and to fur- \\nnifli thefe animals with different fenfations to diredt their \\nSight, and enable them to avoid thofe obfiacles which may \\nprefent themfelves.

Without fludying good collections and.Efruican \\nmonuments, could it have, been poffible to difcover the \\nalphabet of thefe ancient people? Without the repeated re^ \\nfearches of travellers, could it have been hoped that Barthe- \\nlemi would explain the Palrayrean infcriptions ? Without \\npoffeffing and examining the prefent fragment, or fomething \\nof the like kind, could any one with certainty determine the \\nremote period when the art of encauftic was pradtifed, or \\ndifeover the true method in which it was employed ? But \\nwe fhall allow every one to think on this fubjedt as he pleafes. \\nOur academy requires facts and obfervations : any thing elfe \\ndoes not merit its attention. \\nThe ftrft fact, which I think I have proved, is, that the \\nEgyptians were acquainted with and pradtifed wax painting. \\nThe fecond is the better prefervation of colours, and in \\nparticular of the white, by means of encauftic, notwithstand¬ \\ning the revolutions of many centuries. \\nThe third is, that the matter of the Egyptian white colours \\nis not metallic calces or oxydes, which at prefent are ufed \\nin oil painting. \\nAnd the fourth, a deduction from the experiments made \\nof the component parts of the ancient encauftic* which differ \\nvery much from thofe already made known. \\nThofe who are acquainted with the accuracy and certainty \\nof the method not long fince introduced into chemical ope¬ \\nrations, will he convinced that in 24 grains of the encauftic \\npainting, which I ventured to detach from the above-men¬ \\ntioned Egyptian fragment, in order to fubjedt it to examina¬ \\ntion. the mixture of an hundredth part of a foreign fubftance \\nwould have been difeovered with the greateft certainty; that \\nthe refm of Requeno muft undoubtedly have been percepti¬ \\nble to me, and that the alcali of Bachelier and Lorgna could \\nnot have efcaped the counteracting medium. But in this \\nEgyptian encauftic I found nothing except very pure wax, \\nthough I varied my analyfis in every known method. I muft \\ntherefore conclude that modern learned writers, at leaft in \\nrefpedt \\n', \"On 'Eikctujtic Palntlng.» \\nrel^edl to this Egyptian mode of painting, were as far from \\nthe truth as the accounts of ancient authors appear to me \\nprecife and fatisfa&ory; and that the encauftum with which \\nformerly the fore part of fliips and the walls of houfes and \\ntemples were painted, was fomething different from foap or \\nrefmous crayons (paflello dr majlicc). \\nThe bafis however of the ancient pigments for the fkin \\nwas perhaps formed of a waxy foap, with which they com¬ \\nbined lake (fuco) and white lead; and hence perhaps arofe \\nthe well-known common expreffion, which Is ftill figuratively \\nufed, when people fay that a face has buona or cattiva cera? \\naccording as the complexion appears healthful or fickly* \\nBut as thofe who at prefent prepare paints for the fkin do not \\nufe that oil which the portrait-painters employ, it is not im¬ \\nprobable that the ancients made ufe of one compofition for \\npaintings, and another for improving the natural complexion \\nof the female fkin. \\nI am well aware that it will be afked: In what manner can- \\nwax at prefent be rendered fufficiently liquid for the ftrokes of \\nthe pencil, if it be not converted into powder or foap ? This \\nqueftion, in my opinion, can he fully anfwered from the words \\nof an ancient author, and in the next place by experience. \\nVitruvius in particular, book vii. chap. ix. expreffes hirn- \\nfeli in the following clear manner : \\nThofe,” fays he, who wifli to retain cinnabar on \\nwalls, cover it, when it has been well laid on and dried, with \\nPunic wax diluted in a little oil (let this be well remarked) ; \\nand after they have fpread out the wax with a hair bmfh, \\nthey heat the wall by means of a brazier filled with burning \\neoals (hence it is called encauftic painting), and then make \\nit imooth and level by rubbing it with wax tapers and clean \\ncloths, as is done when marble ftatues are covered with wax. \\n1 he effedi of this wax cruft is, that the colour is not deftroyed \\nby the light of the fun or the moon.” \\nIt here appears by thefe words of Vitruvius that the \\nHomans, who copied the Grecian procefs, which the latter \\n9 borrowed \\ni \\n\", \"144 Pnctiujlic ’Painting'* \\nborrowed from the Egyptians, mixed the wax with an oil to \\nmake it pliable under the brufh ; but no madic, alkali or \\nhoney, as has been ingenioudy imagined, and which fome \\nhave thought might be employed with fuccefs. The difficulty \\nnow will be confined to point out in what manner this oil \\n%vas employed. It does not. appear that they ufed thole fat \\noils which are commonly called drying oils; beeaufe they \\ncould have employed thefe as wre do, without the addition of \\nwax, which in fuch a cafe would have been entirely fuper- \\nfiuous. Fat oils which do not dry would not have been pro¬ \\nper for that purpofe, as they would have kept the wax conti* \\nmially in the hate of a foft pomade or falve. Befides, my \\nexperiments would without doubt have fhewn me the evidence \\nof any oily matter. \\nWith regard to effential or volatile oils, a knowledge of \\nthem is not allowed to the ancients, as the invention of dif- \\ntilling is not older than the eighth or ninth century, and \\ntherefore falls in with the period of Geber or Avicenna* \\nBut Herodotus fpeaks in a very clear manner of the didilla^ \\ntion of afphaltcs, which was made at Sufa ; and I, who dif- \\ntinguifli fo much chemical knowledge among the Egyptians^ \\ncannot fuppoie them ignorant of fo eafy a procefs. In the \\ntemple of Vulcan at Memphis they had a fchool of chemidry, \\nwhich dourifhed there for a long time, as we are told by \\nZofimiis Panoplitanus, Eufebius, Sinefius, Albufaragiiis, &c* \\nIn order to ufe wax in their encaudic painting, it is- certain \\nthat they mud have combined it with an ethereal volatile oil, \\nol which no traces thould afterwards remain; beeaufe this \\nwas required for the folidity of the work, and beeaufe I \\nactually found this to be the cafe in the fragment which I \\nexamined. But though they might be unacquainted with \\nthe art of feparating ethereal oils from the manyMubdan-res \\nwhich they contain, they certainly were acquainted with a \\nvery volatile thin oil produced by nature, and which in varfo \\n©us places Lffues from the earth, but probably not in Greece* \\nas I found reafon to conjecture from the following obferva- \\ntions 3 \\n\", \"On Eftcaujlic Painting. i \\nlions. Strabo and Plutarch relate that the people of Ecba- \\ntana5 in order that they might exhibit a pleafing fpedtacle to' \\nAlexander the Great, fhewed him a flaming ftream, by \\nfprinkling rock-oil in the ftreets of a village, and then fettino* \\nr* • *>—- 3 \\nlire to it. They alfo rubbed oyer with naptha a naked boy, \\nand then letting fire to it in the like manner caufed him to \\nran about in a bath. Thefe people then \\\\yere acquainted \\nwuh naptha, which ifilied from the earth in that diftridt ; \\nbut it was not known in Greece, at leaf; to the common \\npeople, as it never was leen by them under the like circum- \\nflances. ibis ethereal oil was ufed, in my opinion, to \\nrender wax lit for painting; and it is’ natural to fuppofe that \\nit would be firfl employed for this ufe where it was firft \\nknown. It appears to me that the Greeks, as was the cafe \\nwith many other things, and as the above-quoted authors \\nfa}, learned en can (tie from the Egyptians, as; the latter \\nlearned it perhaps from the Afiyrians or Glial deans. We \\nknow that Xyfippus wrote exprefsly under one of his pic¬ \\ntures: 44 Painted in encaufticwhich he would not have \\ndone, had not this kind of painting beefenew or a feeret in \\nGreece. \\nNaptha is an ethereal oil much lighter titan' fulphuric ether \\nitlclf, as I found, contrary to common opinion, by my ex¬ \\nperiments. It is an exceedingly volatile oil. Which entirely \\nAGs off and evaporates without leaving a' Angle trace of it \\nbehind. On account of this property naptha is ufed, as is \\nwell known, to copy fignatures and mahuferipts, by rubbing \\nit over the paper-to which it may be requifite to transfer \\nany writing, as it makes it perfe&ly tranfparent. The paper \\ntlien becomes opake and white as before, after the naptha \\nhas evaporated. Such in all probability was the cafe with' \\nthe oil, which Vitruvius does not fpecifiy, but which, as he \\nfays, was combined with the wax. It was for this reafon \\nthat I found no oil in the Egyptian wax painting when I ex¬ \\namined it. We have therefore difeovered ths real mixture \\ntiled tor the ancient encauftic painting. \\nVox. L t- \\n\", \"I \\nJ46 On Encavjlic Fainting. \\nBut, to bring my affertion^ to greater certainty, it was ne-* \\nceflary not only to prove the abfence of every foreign matter \\nin the above-mentioned encauftic fragment by means of an \\naccurate analyfis, and to form foine conjecture what kind of \\noil mud have been combined with the wax, but it was necef- \\nfary alio to fearch for an imitation of it fynthetic&lly; and I . \\nhad the good fortune to meet with a favourable opportunity \\nof gratifying my wi flies in this refoect. \\nIn the year 1785 my worthy friend Gultenbrunn, an \\neminent Saxon painter, now in London, refided at Florence. \\n1 prepared for him a folution of Venetian wax in highly \\npurified naptha, and deli red him to mix up with it the \\ncolours neceffary for a painting. Fie immediately complied \\nwith my requeft; and we were both aflonifhed, as well as all \\nour friends, at the high tone which the colours albumed, \\nand the agreeable luftre which the painting afterwards ac¬ \\nquired, when it had been rubbed over with a foft cloth. I \\nobferved that, in following this procefs, the artifl can de¬ \\ntermine the effect of the colours from their appearance on \\nthe pallet. This is not the cafe when the wax is combined \\nwith alkali, gum, or mattic, by which the pigments'have-a \\ndifferent appearance under the pencil, from that which they \\nought to have on the painting; becaufe the painting, until it \\nhas been dried, heated, and v ami hied, appears muddy and. \\nobfeure. At this period I had only conjecture in my favour \\nrefpebting the coiupofition of encauftic; but the. remit \\nof the above trial, and, ftill more, my examination of the \\nEgyptian fragment, fb often mentioned already, freed me from \\nall doubt. \\nT made another preparation of the like kind for that cele¬ \\nbrated painter Ad duello, by combining a- quantity of the \\ncommon fpi-rit of turpentine {iicqiia ragin') with wax, the good \\neffect of which was alfo extolled by that artifl. The pur- \\npofe for which at prefent I would apply a preparation of \\nthis kind, is to daub over fome of thole beautiful paintings in \\nfrefco by Qiovanni da San-Giovanni, to be feen in the court \\nof \\n\", 'On Pncauflic Painting.

I fliall now proceed to give an idea of \\nthefe Lift refu Its, which depend on laws of decrements whole \\nlilies of departure are not parallel to the edges of the primi¬ \\ntive form, but to the diagonals of its faces. \\nTo alii ft the imagination in conceiving the method which \\nI have followed to in vefti gate thefe new decrements, I (hall \\nremark, that the fame fubllances which exhibit the dodeeae- \\nJron with pentagonal planes originating from the cube \\n(fig. 19 and 20), and which might even d flume the form of \\nthe dodecaedron whofe planes are rhombufes {Jig. 5 and 6), \\nare found alfo under that of the regular obhiedron. But it \\nappears, on the firft view, that it might be poflihle to bring \\nthe liru&ure of this oelaedrorf to a decrement on the edges \\nof a cube; for, if we eonfin'e ourfcivOs to make the la mi me’ \\nof lupefpoiitioii cccreafe' only on the .edges' of the two oppo¬ \\nsite faces of this cube, for example, on thofe of the fuperior \\nhafe A B C D {Jig. 6), and of the inferior bale, we fliall' \\nhave in general two pyramids applied oh thefe bales; and \\nif we fuppofe further that the faces of thefe pyramids are' \\nextended until they meet, which is nothing clfe than conti¬ \\nnuing the effedt ol the law of decrements in the fpace fitu- \\nated between the bafes of the cube, we fliall arrive at an oc- \\ntaedron. the angles of which will vary according as the law \\nlhall determine a greater or fmaller number of ranges fub- \\ntracted. But theory demon ft rates that there is no law, \\nhowever complicated it may be fuppofed, which is capable \\nSf giving equilateral triangles as the faces of this octaedron. \\nO11 the other hand, if we divide a regular o6taedronr ori¬ \\nginating from a cube, we fliall perceive that the cubic nu¬ \\ncleus is litmtcd in this odtaedion in fuch a manner that each \\nof \\n\", \"of its fix folid angles correfponds to the centre of one of the \\nfaces of the odtaedron, which could not be the cafe on the \\nhypothefis of a decrement on the edges. From this relation \\nbf petition, added to the impoffibility of applying here the \\ntheoretic Calculus,, I have concluded that the law of decre¬ \\nments accompliihes its end, in fuch cafes, by a progrefs differ^ \\nent from that which conducts to the forms before defcribed 3 \\nand my refearches, irt regard to that point, have unfolded a \\nnew order of fadts which add much to the fecundity of cryf- \\ntallifation, and at the fame time to that of its theory. But \\non this fubjedt it is neeeffary to enter into a more particular \\ninveftigation. \\nLet A B C D {jig. 27) be the fuperior or inferior furface \\nof a lamina cbmpofed of fmall cubes, the bafes of which are \\nreprefented by the fquares that fub-divide the whole fquare. \\nIf we confider the feries of cubes to which the fquares a, b, c, \\ntf, e,f,g, b, i, belong, it is evident that all th'efe cubes will be \\non the diagonal drawn from A to C, and that they will form \\none firing {jig. 28), which will not differ from the bring of \\nthe cubes a, n, r', s', f, u\\\\ z, cd, {jig. 27) lying in the \\ndiredtion of the edge AD; except in this, that in the former \\nthe cubes touch only by one of their edges, and in the lat¬ \\nter by one of their faces. We {hall obferve at the fame \\ntime, throughout the whole extent of the lamina, firings of \\nCubes parallel to the diagonal one of which is pointed out by \\nthe feries of letters q, v, k, u, x,y, z, ariother by that of the \\nletters n, i, l, m, p, 0, r, s, and fo of the reft. \\nWe may conceive then that the laminae of fuperpofition, \\ninftead of projecting beyond each other one or more ranges \\nbf cubes, in a difedtion parallel to the edge, projedt beyond \\neach other in a diredtion parallel to the diagonal; and we \\n{hall conftrudt in the like manner arbund the cubic nucleus \\nfolids of different figures, by placing, fucceflively, above \\nthe different faces of this nucleus, laminae, which may arile \\nin the form of pyramids, and which will experience the kind \\nbf decrement juft defcribed.

It may be \\nreadily feen by this difpofition that the fquares A ay B b} Cq \\nB dy (Jig* 30), remain uncovered, which will fulfil the law' \\nof decrement above deferibed.

For a- little attention will fiiew, that if this were \\nnot the eale, that is to fay, if the edges of the lamina repre¬ \\nsented fig. 31 as well as the following, coincided with the \\njfejes ST, EZ, Y X, M U, on which fuppofition they would \\nbe on a level with A D, A B, C D, B C, (Jig.. 30)., they \\nwould Term; re-entering angles towards the- analogous parts- \\n- * • * -> <r<f- \\n\", 'cf the cryftal.

Method to dejiroy or drive away Earth-worms and various \\nother Infeffs hurtful to Fields and Gardens, by M. So CO¬ \\nLO ff. From the New Tranfadtions of the Imperial Aca¬ \\ndemy of Sciences at Peterfburgh, Vol. V \\nT HOUGH it is certain that earth-worms occafion great \\ndeftrudlion by gnawing the tender roots of ftirubs and plants, \\nand that other infedts, fuch as caterpillars and locufts, are \\nexceedingly hurtful both to fields and gardens, few have \\ngiven themfelves the trouble to devife any remedy for this \\nevil. I flatter myfelf, therefore, that I fhall do a fervice to \\nthe public if I point out an eafy and fure method, certified by \\nexperience, of either killing or driving away from fields and \\ngardens ail noxious vermin. \\nAs the deftrudtive power of quick-lime, heightened by a \\nfixed alkali, which corrodes, diflolves and deftroys all the \\ntender parts of animals, has been long known, I thought \\nhis mixture would be the beft means for accomplifhing the \\nobjedf I had in view. I took three parts, therefore, of quick¬ \\nlime \\n', \"§y© IS’lethod of dcjlroying Inf efts* \\nlime, newly made, and two parts of a faturated folut'ion of \\nfixed alkali in water, and thence obtained a fomewhat milky \\nliquor fufficiently cauflic, highly hoftile and poifonous to \\nearth-worms and other fmall animals; for, as foon as it \\ntouched any part of their bodies, it occafioned in them vio¬ \\nlent fymptoms of great uneafinefs, If this liquor be poured \\ninto thofe holes in which the earth-worms refide under \\nground, they immediately throw themfelves out as if driven \\nby fame force; and, after various contortions, either lam \\nguifh or die. If the leaves of plants or fruit-trees, fre¬ \\nquented by the voracious caterpillars, which are £p deftracr \\ntive to them, be fprinkled over with this liquor, thefe infects \\nfuddenly contract their bodies and drop to the ground. For \\nthough nature has defended them tolerably well by their \\nhairy (kins from any thing that might injure their delicate \\nbodies, yet, as foon as they touch with their feet or mouths \\nleaves which have been moiftened by this liquor, they be¬ \\ncome as it were ftupefied, inftanily contrail themfelves, and \\nfall down. \\nI had not an opportunity of trying a like experiment on \\nlocufts : yet we may conclude, and not without probability, \\nfrom their nature, and the general deftruitive qualities of \\nthe above liquor, that they, in the like manner, may be \\ndriven from corn-fields, if it be poffible to fprinkle the corn \\nwith the liquor by means of a machine. \\nWith regard to plants or corn, thefe fuftain no injury from \\nthe liquor, becaufe it has no power over the productions of \\nthe vegetable kingdom, as I have fully learned from expe¬ \\nrience; or, if any hurt is to be fufpeited, all the danger will, \\nhe removed by the firft {bower that falls. This liquor may \\nbe procured in abundance in every place where lime is burnt. \\nIf the lime be frefh, one part of it infufed in about feventy \\nparts of common water will produce real lime-water. The \\nwant of the fixed alkali may be fupplied by boiling wood- \\nallies in water, and thickening the lye by evaporation. \\nThis liquor might be employed alfo to kill bugs and other \\ndomeftip \\n\", 'On the ‘Revivification of Infefls. \\\\jZ \\ntjomeftic infers which are noxious and troublefome; but, \\non account of its ftrong lixivious fmell, which difpofes the \\nhuman body to putridity, I dare not recommend the ufe of it \\njn houfes that are inhabited.

I had occa- \\nfion to obferve this circumftance, for the firft time, in com¬ \\nmon flies 5 for it is well known that thefe infedts are ftrongly \\nattracted by the fmell of fpirit of wine; and that, becoming \\nintoxicated by it, they fall into the liquor, and are drowned. \\nHaving thrown a great number of flies which had pre- \\nriflied in this manner in a glafs, into a ftove among wood \\nallies fcarcely warm, and looking into the ftove a little while \\nafter, on account of fome experiments I was making, I ob“ \\nfetved, not without aftoniftiment, the flies ftart up from the \\nallies, and, after wiping themfelves clean from the duft ad¬ \\nhering to their wjngs, fly away as if nothing had happened \\nto them?£. \\nMy \\ni ■ \\n* A circumftance of a fimilar kind occurred to the late Dr. Franklin, \\nWhile fie refided in France he received from America a quantity of Ma¬ \\ndeira \\n', 'On the Revivification of Injects, \\nMy curiofity being excited by this circumftance, I left a \\nwide-mouthed glafs, into which I had put fome fpirit of wine, \\nuncovered, on purpofe, and, having colle&ed the flies which \\nI afterwards foun^l dead in it, I buried them carefully among \\nthe before-mentioned wood-aflies; and in a little time, when \\nthe moifture of the fpirit had been completely abforbed by \\nthe afhes, I obferved them all revivified. Being; convinced \\nin this manner that the experiment would fucceed with com¬ \\nmon flies, I refolved to make a like trial with other kinds of \\ninfe&s. I therefore took fome fmall beetles, which were \\nthofe neareft at hand, put them into a glafs filled with fpirit \\nof wine, and, when they were perfe&ly dead, covered them \\nwith afhes. Thefe, to my great fatisfa&ion, were reftored \\nto life in the like manner. \\nI made an experiment alfo with a fmall fpider and a young \\nmoth, by depriving them of life five different times within \\nthe courfe of three hours, and always with the wifhed-for \\nfuccefs, except that the fpider, after the laft experiment, \\nwas become fo languid and weak that it could fcarcely \\ncrawl. I found the like effect to be produced on bugs, only \\nthat it was neceffary to keep them longer in the afhes before \\nthey were brought to life. \\nIn regard to butterflies I cannot fpeak with certainty, as \\nthofe on which I made experiments were feeble and fickly. \\nCommon wood-lice on the other hand, after being killed in \\nfpirit of wine, I could not bring to life by the fame means. \\nFurther experiments on this fubjedl I fliall leave to natural - \\nifts and phyficians, who, perhaps, may infer from the above \\nobfervations, that warm wood-allies might be employed, not \\n(teira wine which had been bottled in Virginia. In fome of the bottles he \\nfound a few dead flies, which he expofed to the warm fun, it being then \\nthe month of July, and in lefs than three hours thefe apparently dead ani¬ \\nmals recovered life which had been fo long fufpended. At firft they ap¬ \\npeared as if convuifed ; they then raifed themfelves on their legs, waihed \\ntheir e)es with their fore feet, drefled their wings with thofe behind, and \\nbegan in a little time to fly about.

I prepared the mixture, and- \\nobtained a fomewhat thick ink, which did not flow readily, \\nand with which I could write a few lines, but not without \\ndifficulty. Paper written upon with this ink I burnt in a \\nwood fire, and examined it as foon as it was reduced to \\ncoal. I however found that the words were not more legible \\nthan thofe written with common ink ; for the oxydated' bif¬ \\nmuth communicated its oxygene to the inflammable parts of \\nthe mixture, and the whole was revived into a metallic \\nregulus: leveral fmall grains of regulus' of bifmuth could \\ntherefore be diftinguifhed in it with the naked eye.

Its allies aftord a great quantity of pot-afli, \\nexceeded by few, or perhaps by none, of the trees that grow* \\nin the woods of the United States. \\nThe acer faccharinum is not injured by tapping; on the \\ncontrary, the oftener it is tapped, the more fyrup is obtained \\nfrom it. The effects of a yearly difeharge of fap from the \\ntree in improving and increafing the fap, is demonftrated \\nfrom the fuperior excellence of thofe trees which have been \\nperforated in an hundred places by a fmall wood-pecker \\nwhich feeds upon the fap. The fap of fuch trees is much \\nfweeter to the tafte than that obtained from trees which \\nhave not been previously wounded, and more fugar is \\nafterwards procured. In this lafl: particular it follows a law \\nof the animal oeconomy. It is well known, that when a \\nperfon has been once tapped, the procefs requires afterwards \\nto be more frequently repeated. A Angle tree has not only \\nfurvived, but flouriflied after forty-two tappings in the fame \\nnumber of years. \\nA tree of an ordinary fize yields, in a good feafon, from \\ntwenty to thirty gallons of fap, from which are made from \\nfive to fix pounds of fugar. To this there are fometimes \\nremarkable exceptions. Samuel Low, Efq. a jufticeof peace \\nin Montgomery county, in the State of New York, informed \\nArthur Noble, Efq. that he had made twenty pounds and \\none ounce of fugar from the 14th to the 23d of April, in the \\nyear 1789, from a Angle tree that had been tapped for feveral \\nfucceffive years before. The quantity obtained per diem \\nvaries from five gallons to a pint, according to the variations \\nof the w‘eather. The influence which this has in increafing \\nor leflening the difeharge of the flip is very remarkable. I \\nhave feen a journal of the effe<Ts of heat, cold, moifture, \\n■drought, and thunder, upon the difeharges from the fugar \\ntree; which difpofes me to believe there is fome foundation \\nN4 \\nm \\n', \"184 Account of the American Sugar Maple. \\nin Dr. Tongue’s opinion, who fuppofes that changes in the \\nweather of every kind might be as readily afcertained by \\ndifcharges of fap from trees, as by the barometer.

If frofty nights fucceed a warm day, there is always a \\ntotal fufpenfton of the difcharge *. \\nThe \\n* Dr. Hale, in his Vegetable Statics, relates that he cut down a vine, and \\ncemented to its mutilated dump glafs tubes, each 7 feet long, and one \\nfourth of an inch diameter, with brafs caps, by which they were fciewed \\non one above another, till they rofe to the height of 36 feet. \\nBy thefe gages it appeared, \\nid.- That the fap began to rife March 10, when the thermometer by \\nday flood only at 3 degrees above the freezing point. \\nadly.

That if warm weather had made the fap flow vigoroufly, that \\nvigour would be abated immediately by a cold eaderly wind and a cloudy \\nfun, when the fap would fink at the rate of an inch per minute.; but when \\nthe fun fhone out, and the wind fhifted, it rofe again as ufual. \\n8thly. The oldefl vines were fooneft affe&ed by a change of tempera¬ \\nture, and in them the fap fird began to fink. \\n9thly. And, on the contrary, when the tube was fixed to a very fhort \\nflump of a young vine, and at only 7 inches from the ground, the fap \\nflowed inceffantly, and failed of all, in the greateft heat of the day, finking \\nonly after fun-fet. \\nHe then makes this general conclufion, that the rapidity with which the \\nfap circulates in the vine during the fpring, is five times greater than the \\nrapidity with which the blood flows in the arteries of a horfe; that it is \\nconfiderably flower in the dimmer than in fpring, very languid in autumn, \\nand ceafes altogether in the winter. \\nThe \\n\", 'Account of the American Sugar Maple, 185 \\nThe Tap ufoally flows for fix weeks, varying according to \\nthe temperature of the weather. The feafon for tapping is \\nin February, March, and April. During the remaining part \\nof the fpring months, as alfo in the fummer, and in the be¬ \\nginning of autumn, the maple tree yields a thin lap, but not \\nlit for the manufactory of fugar. \\nBaron La Hontan gives - the following account of the fap \\nof the fugar maple tree, when ufed as drink, and the manner \\nof obtaining it. The tree, fays he, yields a ftp which has a \\nmuch pleafanter tafte than the beft lemonade or cherry \\nwater, and is the wholefomeft drink m the world. This \\nliquor is drawn by cutting the tree two inches deep in the \\nwood, the cut being made Hoping to the length of ten or \\ntwelve inches; at the lower end of this gjafh, a knife is \\nthruft into the tree flopingly, fo that the water runs along \\nthe cut or gafli, as through a gutter, pervades the knife, and \\nfalls upon fome veflfels placed underneath to receive it. \\nThe gafh does no harm to the tree. Some trees will yield \\nfive or fix bottles of this water in a day, and many inhabitants \\nof Canada might draw* twenty hogfheads of it in one day, if \\nthey had a mind to notch all the maple trees upon their \\nplantations 3 but common things are flighted, and fcarce any \\nbut children think of extracting this liquor from the trees. \\nThe mode of tapping is different, and is performed \\nwith an axe or an auger. The latter is preferred, from ex¬ \\nperience of its advantage. It is introduced about three \\nquarters of an inch, and is afterwards deepened gradually to \\nthe extent of two inches. A fpout is introduced about half \\nThe above experiments clearly demonftrate, that it is not from heat \\nand light alone that the fap riles in the vine, or any other tree; for, if that \\nwere the cafe, it would increafe as the heat increafed; it would be greateft. \\nin the noon-day, and in the height of fummer, and lefs in fpring than in \\nautumn, whereas the reverfe is here Ihewn to be the cafe.

The operation of tapping is fil'd done on the fouth \\nfide; and when the difcharge of fap lefiens, an opening is \\nmade with the auger on the north lide, when an abundant \\nflow takes place. \\nWooden troughs large enough to contain three or four \\ngallons are placed under the fpout to receive the fap, which \\nis carried every day to a large receiver made of wood. From \\nthis receiver it is conveyed, after being drained, to the boiler. \\nThe following fa£ls have been afeertained by experiment: \\nThe fooner the fap is boiled, after it is collected from the \\ntree, the better. The larger the veflfel the more fugar is ob¬ \\ntained. The fugar is alfo improved by draining the fap \\nthrough blankets, or cloth, either before or after it is half \\nboiled. Some fatty fubdance is added to the fap in the \\nkettle, to prevent its boiling over. Lime, eggs, or new milk, \\nis mixed with it in order to clarify it. I have feen clear \\nfugar made without the addition of cither of them. A \\nfpoonful of dack lime, the white of one egg, and a pint of \\nnew milk, are the ufual proportions of thefe articles, which \\n0 \\nare mixed with fifteen gallons of fap. The maple fugar \\nclarified with milk alone had the evident fuperiority of all \\nothers. After being fufhciently boiled, it is grained, and \\nclayed, and afterwards refined, or converted into loaf fugar. \\nThe method of conducting each of thefe proced'es is fo \\nnearly the fame with thofe which are ufied in the manufac¬ \\ntory of Wed India fugar, and are fo generally known, that \\nI need fpend no time in deferibing them. \\nThere are two other methods of reducing the fap to fugar. \\nThe fird is by freezing. This method was tried by Mr. Scott, \\na farmer in this date, with great fuccefs. He fays, that one \\nhalf of a given quantity of fap reduced in this way,* is better \\nthan one third of the fame quantity reduced by boiling. If \\nthe frod diould not be intenfe enough to reduce the fap to \\nthe graining point, it may afterwards be expofed to the \\naCiion of fire for that purpofe. \\nSecondly, \\n\", 'V \\nAccount of the American Sugar Maple. 187 \\nSecondly, byJpontaneous evaporation.

The quality of this fugar is neceflarily better than that \\nwhich is made in the Weft Indies, It is prepared in a fea- \\nfon when not a Angle infedf exifts to feed upon it, or to \\nmix its excretions with it. The fame obfervation cannot be \\napplied to the Weft India fugar. The infedts and worms \\nwhich prey upon it, and of courfe mix with it, compofe a \\npage in a nomenclature of natural hiftory. I Iftall fay not \\n', 'i88 \\nAccount of the American Sugar Maple, \\nthing of the hands which are employed in making fugar in \\nthe Weft Indies; for llaves have not that obligation to clean- \\nlinefs which thofe have who work for their own benefit, and \\nhave received a proper education. It has been conceived \\nthat the maple fugar is inferior to the Weft India fugar in \\nftrength. The experiments which led to this opinion I fuf- \\npe£t have been inaccurate, or have been made with maple \\nfugar prepared in a ftovenly way. I have examined equal \\nquantities by weight of both the grained and the loaf fugar, \\nin hyfon tea, and in coffee, made in every refpect equal by \\nthe minuteft circumftances that could affeCt the quality or \\ntafte of each of them, and could perceive no inferiority in the \\nftrength of the maple fugar. The liquors which were to de¬ \\ncide this queftion were examined at the fame time by Alex¬ \\nander Hamilton, Efq. fecretary of the treafury of the United \\nStates, Mr. Henry Drinhur, and feveral ladies, who all con¬ \\ncurred in the above opinion. \\n2. Price. Whoever confiders that the gift of the fugar \\nmaple tree is from a benevolent Providence; that we have \\nmany millions of acres in our country covered with them ; \\nthat the tree is improved by repeated tappings; and that the \\nlugar is obtained by the frugal labour of a farmer’s family; \\nand at the fame time confiders the labour of cultivating the \\nlugar cane, the capitals funk in fugar works, the firft coft of \\nllaves and cattle, and the expences of provifions for both. \\nSee. will not hefitate in believing that the maple fugar may be \\nmanufactured much cheaper, and fold at a confiderably lefs. \\nprice than that which is made in the Weft Indies. \\n3. The refources for making a fufficient quantity of this \\nin gar, not only for the confumption of the United States, but \\nfor exportation, will appear from the following faCts:—There \\nare hi the hates of New York and Pennfylvania alone, at \\nleaft ten millions of acres of laud which produce the fugar \\nmaple tree in the proportion of thirty trees to one acre.. \\nNow, fuppofing all the perfons capable of labour in a family \\nto conftft of three, and each perfon to attend 130 trees, and \\neach \\n', \"Account of the American Sugar Maple. 189 \\neach tree to yield 5 pounds of fugar, the product of labour of \\n60,000 families would be 135,000,000 pounds of fugar, and, \\nallowing the inhabitants of the United States to compofe \\n600,000 families, each of which confumed 200 pounds of \\nfugar a year, the whole confumption would be 120,000,000 \\npounds a year, which would leave a balance of 15,000,000 \\npounds for exportation. Valuing the fugar at 6—90 of a \\ndollar per pound, the fum faved would be 8,000,000 dollars \\nof home confumption, and the fum gained by exports!ion \\nwould be 1,000,000 dollars. \\nThe maple fugar alfo affords excellent vinegar; its molaffes \\nis capable of affording a very pleafant fummer beer. The, \\nfap is alfo capable of producing fpirit; but we hope this \\nwholefome juice will never be proftituted to fuch a purpofe. \\nA diet con lifting of a plentiful admixture of fugar has many \\nadvantages. \\nSugar affords the greateft quantity of nourifhment in a \\ngiven quantity of matter of any fubftance in nature. Hence \\nthe Indians ufe it in their excurfions. They mix a certain \\nquantity of maple fugar with an equal quantity of Indian \\ncorn, dried and powdered. This mixture is packed up in \\nlittle bafkets. A few fpoonfuls of it mixed with half a pint \\nof fpring water, afford them a pleating and ftrengthening \\nmeal. From the great degree of ftrength and nourifhment \\nwhich are conveyed into animal bodies by a fmall bulk of \\nfugar, it may be given to horfes with great advantage. A \\npound of fugar with grafs or hay, I have been told, has flip- \\nported the ftrength and fprrits of a horfe during a whole \\nday’s labour in one of the Weft India iflands. A larger \\nquantity given alone has fattened horfes and cattle during the \\nwar before laft in Iiifpaniola, for a period of feveral months, \\nin which the exportation of fugar and the importation of \\ngrain were prevented by the want of drips. \\n3. A plentiful ufe of fugar is the belt preventative of \\nworms.

I think it probable, that the frequency of malignant \\nfevers of all kinds has been JefTened by this diet, and that its \\nmore general ufe would defend that clafs of people who are \\nmod fubjedf to malignant fevers from being fo often affedted \\nby them. \\n5. It has be£n faid, that fugar injures the teeth; but this \\nopinion now has fo few advocates, that it does not merit a \\nferious refutation. \\nIt has been a fubjedt of enquiry, whether the maple fugar \\nmight not be improved in its quality, and increafed in its \\nquantity, by culture. From the influence which culture has \\n- upon forefl and other trees, it has been fuppofed, that by \\ntranfplanting the maple fugar tree into a garden, or by de~ \\nflroying fuch other trees as {belter it from the rays of the \\nfun, much advantage might accrue. I know but of one fadt. \\nA farmer in Northampton county, in the date of Pennfyl- \\nvania, planted a number of thefe trees above twenty years \\nago in his meadow, and he declares that the quality is fo \\nimproved, that from three gallons of the fap he obtains every \\nyear a pound of fugar; and it is a known circumdance \\nthat, to produce the fame quantity of fugar from the trees \\nwhich grow wild in the wood, it requires five or fix gallons \\nof fap. To tranfmit to future generations all the advantages \\nwhich have been here enumerated, it is neceflary that this \\ntree fhould be cultivated in the old and improved parts of \\nthe United States, and a bounty given upon the maple fu¬ \\ngar by Government. Afterwards men would find out their \\nown advantage in rearing them. An orchard confiding \\nof 200 trees, planted upon a common form, would yield more \\nprofit than the fame number of apple or any other trees. \\nIf a greater expofure of a tree to the adtion of the fun has \\nthe fame effedt upon the maple that it has upon other trees, \\na larger quantity of fugar might reafonably be expedfed \\nfrom each tree planted in an orchard. Allowing it to be \\nonly feven pounds, then 200 trees will yield 1400 pounds \\nof fugar; and dedudting 200 from the quantity for the con- \\nfumption of fthe family, there will remain for fale 1200 \\npounds,, \\n', \"Mr. Park’s Journey into Africa. ioi \\npounds, which at 6—90 of a dollar per pound will yield an \\nannual profit to the farmer of 80 dollars. Should this mode \\nof tranfplanting for the purpofe of obtaining fugar be fuc- \\ncefsful, it will not be a new one. The fugar cane of the \\nWeft Indies was brought originally from the woods of the \\nEaft Indies by the Portuguefe, and cultiyated at Madeira, \\nIrom whence it was tranfplanted diredlly or indirectly to all \\nthe fugar iflands of the Weft Indies. \\nIn contemplating the prefent opening profpeCts in human \\naffairs, I am led to expeCl that a material fliare of the hap- \\npinefs which Heaven feems to have prepared for all man¬ \\nkind, will be derived chiefly from the manufactory' and \\ngeneral ufe of the maple fugar, which I flatter myfelf will \\nnot be confined to us, but wilbextend itfelf to other na¬ \\ntions. With this vie\\\\vof the fubjeCt, I cannot help contem¬ \\nplating a fugar American maple tree with a fpecies of affec¬ \\ntion and even veneration; for I have perfuaded myfelf to \\nbehold in it the happy means of rendering the commerce' \\nand flaveryof our African brethren in the Weft India iflands \\nas unneceflary as it has always been inhuman and unjuft *. \\nXYT.

This prince wifhed to per- \\nfuade Mr. Park not to profecute his journey any farther, \\nby pointing out the dangers and difficulties he would have \\nto encounter; Tut finding his remonftrances had no effect, \\nhe furnifhed him with a guide to Bondon, and fuffiered him. \\nto depart. \\nLeaving Medina, Mr. Park proceeded onwards, and on \\n9 the \\n', \"Mr. Park's Journey into Africa. jgo \\n21ft of December reached Fatteconda, the capital of \\nthe kingdom of Bc^dou. The king of this country was a \\nPagan, like that of Woolli: but he had adopted the Moor¬ \\nish name of Alm^mi, and feems alfo to have imbibed fome- \\nwhat of the Moorifh difpofition; for though Mr. Park \\nprelented to him his umbrella and Fome other articles, he \\ncompelled him to ftrip in his prefence and furrender his \\ncoat, which he Taid Are thould referve for his own wearing \\non great and public feftivals.

He had \\nrecently fallen out with a neighbouring prince, thefovereign \\nof KafTon, a country to the north-eaft; and it happened that \\nthe king of Kaffon’s nephew was in Bacheri’s capital, en¬ \\ndeavouring, but in vain, to effect a reconciliation at the \\ntime of Mr. Park’s arrival at Joag. This young man, finding \\nthat our traveller propofed proceeding to Kalfon, kindly of¬ \\nfered to take him under his protection. They accordingly \\nfet out together, and, after a journey of two days, eroded \\nthe river Senegal at Kayee, the frontier village of the king \\nol Kaffion’s dominions, near which that river ceafes to be \\nnavigable. From Kayee Mr. Park was led by his friendly \\nconductor to Teefee, the place of his abQde, and the red- \\ndence of the king’s brother Tigetee-Sego, an old man of a \\nVol.I.

He had never \\nfeen, he faid, but one white man before, and, on defcribing \\nhim, it was known to be Major Houghton. The circum- \\nftance of having a white man under his roof was highly \\ngratifying to the vanity of Tigetee-Sego, on account of the \\ngreat number of the natives who reforted to fee him. He \\ntherefore compelled our traveller to remain with him twelve \\ndays, and afterwards to take a journey of two days more to \\nprefent hirnfelf to the king at his capital of Kooniakary, \\nwho detained him another fortnight, but in other refpe&s’ \\nbehaved to him with great kindnefs and hofpitality. Of this \\nprince, whofe name was Demba Sego Jalla, Mr. Park re¬ \\nceived the fir ft certain account of Major Houghton’s death. \\nBeing permitted at length to leave the capital, Mr. Park \\nprofecuted his journey eaftward, and in five days arrived at \\nKemnoo, a large and populous town (fince deftroyed), at that \\ntime the metropolis of Kaarta. The fovereign, whofe name \\nwas Dayfi Koorabarri, received Mr. Park with great kind¬ \\nnefs. Major Houghton was the only European he had ever \\nbefore feen, and he had conceived the higheft idea of the \\nfuperiority of the whites to the blacks in all poffible refpedfs. \\nThe language of the country feemed to Mr. Park to be a \\nmixture of the Mandingo and Sera-Woollibut the pure \\nMandingo, in the attainment of which Mr. Park by this \\ntime had made confiderable proficiency, was very generally \\nunderftood, and with very little affiftance from his inter¬ \\npreter he found no difficulty in conveying his own fenti- \\nments, and comprehending others. \\nHaving informed the king that he propofed going to Bam- \\nbara in fearch of theJoliba river, which was believed to take \\nits courfe through the centre of that extenfive kingdom, he \\nwas told that, the Bambarans being at that time in a ftate of \\nwarfare with the Kaartans, he could not without extreme \\nperfonal danger venture into the Bambaran country. His \\nonly fafe route was a northerly courfe to Ludamar, a terri¬ \\ntory of the Moors in alliance- with Manfong the king of \\nBambarsf; \\n\", \"Mr. PdrFs Journey into Africa. 195 \\nBambara; from whence, paffing as a traveller from the \\nMoorifh country, he might venture, by a circuitous journey, \\nto Bambara.

In the courfe of his journey he palled through \\na village nOt far from Jarra* called Simbing, from whence \\nMajor Houghton wrote his laid difpatch with a pencil. \\nThe territories which our traveller had hitherto explored* \\nbeing very generally clothed with native woods, prefented to \\n' ’ 1 \\nthe eye the appearance of great uniformity. In his progrefs \\neaftward the country rdfe into hills, and the foil varied to a \\neonliderable degree 3 but wherever the land was cleared, great \\nnatural fertility was obferved. Bondou in particular may \\nliterally be pronounced u a land flowing with milk and \\nhoney.” Both thefe articles, together with rice and Indian \\ncorn of two or three fpeci.es, were to be obtained at a fmall \\nCxpence. Of their honey, the Pagan natives make an in¬ \\ntoxicating liquor, much like the mead of Europe. The \\nprice of a fowl in Bondou was a button, or a fmall bit of am¬ \\nber 3 goat’s flefh and Mutton were proportionably Cheap; \\nand for fix or eight amber beads Mr. Park might at any time \\nhave purchafed a bullock.

But the natives of Africa have not yet acquired the \\nart of taming the lalHmeritioned animal* notwithstanding \\nbis flrength and docility, fo as to render him Serviceable to \\nman; and when Mr. Park told fome of them that this was \\nactually done in the countries of the Eaft, his auditors \\nlaughed, and exclaimed, Tobaubo fonnio !*’ A white man’s \\n,0 % be 1 \\n\", \"196 J\\\\±r Park's Journey into Africa. \\nlie ! —The negroes frequently find means to deftrov the wild \\nelephant with fire-arms; they hunt it principally for the \\nlake of its teeth, which they transfer in barter to thofe who* \\nfell them again to the Europeans. \\nThe paftures of Bondou furnifh an excellent breed of \\nhorfes, but the ufual beaft of burthen in all the negro terri- \\ntories is the afs. The application of animal labour to the.: \\npurpofe of agriculture is wholly unknown.

The town itfelf is- \\nextensive, and the houfes are built of clay and ftone inter- \\nmixed; but the major part of the inhabitants* are negroes \\nfrom the borders of the Southern States, who prefer a pre¬ \\ncarious protection under the Moors, which they purchafe by \\na tribute, to being continually expofed to their predatory \\nhofrilities. \\nDuring his fray at Jarra, Mr. Park refided at the houfe of a. \\nSlatee trader, named Daman, who was known to Dr. Laidley. \\nBy him Mr. Park was informed that he could proceed no \\nfarther on his way to Bambara, without leave from Ali, the \\nMoorifh chief or king of the country, who was then en¬ \\ncamped at a place called Benowm ; and that it was ab- \\nfolutely neceffary that a prefent fliould accompany the appli¬ \\ncation by which permiffion was to be obtained. Mr. Park \\ntherefore purchafed live garments of country cloth, by the \\nfale \\n\", \"Afr. Park's Journey into Africa. 197 \\nfale of one of his fowling-pieces. Daman undertook to \\nnegotiate the bufinels, and at the end of a fortnight permif- \\nfion arrived from Benowm. \\nThis permiffion was brought by one of Air’s own haves, \\nwho fa id he was ordered to ferve Mr, Park as a guide to \\nBambara; and on the 2,7th of February he took Ills depar¬ \\nture from Jarra, accompanied by this have, his own faithful \\nboy, and a negro belonging to Daman; the interpreter re- \\nfufing to proceed any farther. \\nOn the third day after his departure from Jarra they \\nreached a large town called Deena; on entering which Mr. \\nPark was Surrounded by many of the Moorifh inhabitants, \\nwho haraffed him with {bouts of infult, fpit in his face, and \\nfeized his baggage, which they robbed of what things they \\nfancied. He got refuge, at length, in the houfe of a negro 5 \\nand after experiencing much difficulty in perfuading his at¬ \\ntendants to proceed any farther, he fet out on the fecond day \\nfor Sampaka. Here he procured lodging at the houfe of a \\nnegro, who underftood the art of making gunpowder. The \\nnitre was obtained in conliderabie quantities from the fwamps \\nor ponds, which are filled in the rainy feafon, and to which \\nthe cattle refort in the heat of the day for coolnefs. As the \\nwater of thefe ponds is {lowly exhaled by the fun, the nitre \\nappears in a white efflorefcence on the mud, and is carefully \\nfcrapcd off in the form of fmall cryftals.

They even \\ncounted his toes and fingers, as if they doubted whether he \\nwas in truth a human being. When the curiofity of the \\nladies was in fome meafure fatisfied, he was conduced to \\nthe tent of Ali’s chief Have; into which however he was not \\npermitted to enter,.nor allowed to touch any thing belonging \\nto it.

Hearing one morning the found \\nof drums, Mr, Park was informed that the noife was occa- \\nftoned by the celebration of a wedding in one of the neigh¬ \\nbouring tents.

He was allowed a fingle \\nmeal of koujcous, a preparati on of boiled corn, once in twenty- \\nfour hours. All his effe&s were taken from him, and he \\nwas not even indulged with a change of linen out of the \\nfew diirts he had brought in his portmanteau ; oppreffed at \\nthe fame time with a burning fever, his dtuation was truly \\ndeplorable. “ In this condition, from fun-rife to fun-fet,” \\nfays he, was I obliged to fuller with an unruffled counte¬ \\nnance the infults of the rudeft favages on earth. \\nIn eight or ten weeks, however, circumlfances occurred, \\nwhich, contrary to their firft appearance, changed our \\ntraveller’s fituation for the better, and in the end produced \\nhis delu e-ance. In the w’ar which prevailed between the \\nkings of Bambara and Kaarta, the Moors at-firft took no \\nadtive part; but Ali having afterwards engaged to fend geo \\nhorfe to the abidance of the fugitive Kaartans, he' became \\npanic-ftruck at the approach of the king of Bambara towards \\nBen ,wm : broke up his camp, and fixed his tent in a country \\nto the north.

Analyfs of the Emerald of Peru. By M. Vauq.ue- \\nlin. From the Annales de Chimie, Vol. XXFI. \\nSeveral celebrated chemifts have already analyfed the \\nemerald ; but, as I am convinced that fcience is promoted \\nand individuals inftruhled by repeating the labours of thofe \\nwho have preceded us, I have again fubjehted this foffil to a \\nchemical analyfis. Klaproth, one of the moft accurate ana- \\nlyfers of modern times, found in the emerald of Peru filiceous \\nearth 66.25, alumine 31.25, oxyde of iron 0.50. It will he \\nfeen in the courfe of this fhort memoir, that the refult of my \\nlabour differs from that of the Pruffian chemift, not only in \\nthe proportion of the conftituent principles, but in their \\nnumber, and the nature of fome of them \\nExp. I. This (lone, broken into fmall fragments, and ex- \\npofed to a ftrong heat, loft a part of its beautiful green co¬ \\nlour, and retained only a light {hade of it. In many places of \\nit there were cracks ; and it loll of its weight 0.02 grains. \\nExp. II. Two hundred parts of this foffil, which anfwered \\nto 200 grains, poid de marc (eight ounces to the pound), or \\n10.615 grammes, were melted for an hour in a filver cru¬ \\ncible with 600 parts of cauftic potafh. The matter had then \\na greenifh yellow colour. This folution, when evaporated \\nto a quarter of its 'bulk, was converted into a green jelly, \\nthe fhade of which was much weakened by defecation. \\nThe refidue was diluted in a large quantity of water ; and \\nit was obferved, that the fir ft portions of this liquid, poured ■ \\n* According to the firft analvf.s of the err erald, the refults of which I \\nprefented to the National Inftstute, I found in it fiiiccous earth, a'.umii e, \\nlime, and the oxyde of chrome \\\\ but fince that epoch, having difcoveied a \\nnew earth in the beryl, or aigue marine, I repeated my analyfis, under this \\nnew point of view, and I found alfo that particular earth, as will be fee a \\nin the courfe of this memoir. \\n6 \\nupoq \\n\", 'Analyfis of the Emerald of Perk, 265 \\nttpoh the fubftance, made it a flume a bright and very agree¬ \\nable o-reen colour, ft he folution of the fait had alio the lame \\nfhade, but weaker. There remained a white Infipid fub- \\nftance, full of grains, which was infoluble in water, and had \\nall the properties oi filiceous earth, ft weighed 129 parts, \\nafter having been expofed to a red heat. \\nExp, ill. To the liquor of the fecond experiment, from \\nwhich the filiceous earth had been feparated, I added cauftic \\npotafh, more than neceflary for faturation, and then boiled \\nit for fome time. The greater part of the matter precipi¬ \\ntated was at fir ft re-diflolved; but there remained a certain \\nquantity which obftinately refilled folution. The folution \\nhaving been filtered, the infoluble matter, which, when waffl¬ \\ned and dried, weighed feven parts, was collected on the filter. \\nThis matter had a light lilac colour, which became green \\nby the heat of the blow-pipe. When melted with borax and \\nthe fufible fait of urine, it gave them a fuperb green colour, \\nperfectly like that of the emerald. This property of thus \\ngiving a green colour to borax and microcofmic fait, made \\nme abandon the idea I had firft conceived, that this matter \\nmight be the oxyde of nickel; ftnce.the oxvde of that metal, \\nthough green, communicates to borax a hyacinth colour. As \\nthis colour had a perfedt refemblance to that which I ob¬ \\ntained from the oxyde of the metal * contained in the red lead \\nof Siberia, I directed my experiments with a view to efta- \\nblifh that refemblance. I therefore took this colouring mat¬ \\nter, drawn from the emerald, and boiled it to drynefs with \\nconcentrated nitric acid. I then poured upon the reftdue \\ncauftic potafh, and obtained a folution of an orange-yellow \\ncolour; which when mixed with a lolution of the nitrate of \\nlead immediately produced the red lead of Siberia, and gave, \\nwith the nitrate of mercury, a precipitate of a vermilion red \\ncolour, abfolutely in the lame manner as does the acid of the1 \\nred lead. \\nVauqudin’s account of this new metal, called Chrome, Jfvill be given \\nia our next number. Euit. \\n', '4, , < fi 4 > . j \\n&o5 Anatj’Jis of the Emerald of Peril. \\nThefe experiments, though not numerous, are fufficient id \\nprove, that the colouring matter of the emerald of Peru is \\nnot iron, as announced by Klaproth, but that it is, on the \\nother hand, the oxyde of the new metal which I difcovered \\nin the red lead of Siberia. One thing, however, which ought \\nf i \\nto furprife thofe acquainted with the fagacity and accuracy \\nwhich thechemift of Berlin fheWs in his labours, and which \\nhave gained him fo high reputation, is, that he did hot ob- \\nferve this fubftance, fo eatily to be diftinguifhed by a great \\nnumber of charadferiling marks, entirely different from thofe \\nexhibited by other minerals. I {hall now proceed to other \\nprinciples of the emerald. \\nExp. IV. The reader will recollect that the liquor of the \\nfecond experiment, deprived of its filiceous earth, was pre¬ \\ncipitated by cauftic potafh, and that the precipitate was, in \\ngreat part, re-diffolved by an exeefs of this alkali. This \\niblution was then fuperfaturated with the muriatic acid, and \\ncarbonate of potafh ufed in commerce was poured over it. \\nThis produced a very abundant precipitate, which, being \\nwafhed, and expofed tci a red heat in a filver crucible, weigh¬ \\ned fifty-four parts. \\nThefe fifty-four parts were diffolved in the fulphuric acid ; \\nand the folution, by the addition of a little potafli at intervals, \\ngave, by feveral fucceffive cryftallifations, 149 parts of alum \\ncryfiallifed in o&aedra, among which there-were eight or \\nnine parts of the fulphate of lime; but as thefe 140 parts of \\nalum contained only about twenty-fix parts of pure alumine, \\nand as the mother-water, the tafte of which was exceedingly \\nfaccharine, gave no more alum by the addition of a new \\nquantity of potafh, I diluted it in water, and mixed with it \\na iblution of the carbonate of ammoniac, until there was an \\nexeefs. I fhook this mixture from time to time, for feveral \\nhours ; at the end of which the greater part of the precipi¬ \\ntate, which had been at firfl formed, was diffolved. \\nI then filtered the liquor, and collebted on the paper the un- \\ndiflblved matter, which, when wafhed and dried, weighed! \\ntwo \\n', \"♦ j* c . \\nAnalyfis of the Emerald of Peril, 2,0 f \\ntwo parts, and exhibited all the properties of alumine.

It feema to experience a diurnal and an annual \\nvariation. \\nDiurnal variation.—-Between the hours of ten and two, \\nboth of the day and the night, the rifings and fallings of the \\nmercury are the leaf!.

From the above \\npefiod, therefore, we may predict, very nearly, the tempera¬ \\nture of any given year. This method is praclifed by the \\nmakers of almanacks5 and their predidfions, to a certain de- \\n^gree, may be depended on. This mode of calculation is well \\nknown alfo to merchants who fpeculate in the price of pro- \\nvifions. \\nMaurice at Geneva makes meteorological obfervations of \\nthe utmoft importance, becaufe he has thermometers placed \\nat different heights above the furface of the earth, as Picfet \\nhad formerly, and others at the depth of four feet below it. \\nHe gives an account, therefore, of the evaporation of the \\nearth, electricity, humidity, 8cc. His cbfervations appear \\nevery month in an excellent colledtion, publilhed by the \\nbrothers Pidlet, under the title of Bibliotheque Britannique. \\nIt appears that the thermometer, which is four feet below the \\nearth, hands generally between 90 and io° Reaum.

BlographicalMemoirs of Peter Bayen. By M. LASSUS, \\nSecretary to the Clafs of the Phyjical Sciences in the French \\nNat. Infiitute. From the Annales de Chimie, Vol. XXVI. \\njPETER BAYEN, member of the National Inftitute in the \\nfeflion of chemiftry, was born at Chalons in the department \\nof la Marne, in the year 1725. His parents, obferving that \\nhe had a happy difpofition for learning, took the earlieft op¬ \\nportunity to improve it, by fending him to the college of \\nTroyes, where he ftudied the Latin language with the beft \\nfuccefs. Having terminated the courfe of his ftudies at \\nthat place, he turned his attention to natural philofophy, \\nand, after acquiring the firft principles of chemiftry,. foon \\nbecame \\n\", 'Biographical Memoirs of P. Bayen. % Tj \\nbecame fenfible that, to make any real progrefs in that fcience, \\nthe founded judgment muft be guided by a particular kind \\nof knowledge not fupplied by nature,, and which can be ob¬ \\ntained only by long and affiduous labour. \\nWith a tolerable flock of knowledge, and a defire to ob¬ \\ntain more, Bayen repaired to Paris, where he refided with \\nan eminent apothecary, a friend of the celebrated Charras* \\nThe intelligence and happy difpofitions of the pupil could \\nnot efcape the penetration of the mafter, who, finding in \\nthis young man, fond of fcience, a character and tafte fimi- \\nlar to his own, treated him as his friend rather than a pupil, \\nand procured him every means of inftrudtion, by entrufling \\nhim with the management of his laboratory. His hopes \\nwere not difappointed : Bayen applied for feveral years to \\nall the labours of pharmacy, and acquired fo much (kill in \\nthis art, that, before he had attained to the age of thirty, he \\nwas appointed chief apothecary to the army in Germany \\nduring the war of feven years. The duties of this office he \\ndifcharged with a fuccefs worthy of the confidence which \\nhad been repofed in him; and he fought no other recoin- \\npenfe for the fatigues he underwent, than the fatisfadtion of \\nbeing ufeful in the hofpitals. \\nAfter the peace he returned to Paris. At that period \\ngovernment was defirous of executing a plan it had been \\nlong meditating, which was, to caufe an analyfis to be made \\nof all the mineral waters common in France. Rouelle, be¬ \\ning appointed to make choice of the chemifts capable of dis¬ \\ncharging that ta(k, pointed out Bayen and Venel. They at \\nfirft carried on their labours in conjunction, and publifhed \\nthe refult of their obfervations; but as an enterprife of this \\nnature, to be completed, would require feveral years, and as \\nparticular circumfiances obliged Venel to difcontinue it, the \\nwhole devolved upon Bayen, who applied himfelf to it with \\nthe utmofl affiduity. \\nHe fucceffively publifhed various works, which contained \\nmuch more extenfive information refpedting thefe mineral \\nP 3 waters \\n', '£X4 Biographical Memoirs of P. Bayen* \\nwaters than had ever been before known. The waters which \\nhe in particular analyfed were thofe of Barreges, Bagneres, \\nand Luchon. The analyfis of the latter is a model of corredt- \\nnefs which ought to be followed in works of this nature, \\nand to which nothing could be added. This work, written \\nin a very methodical manner, while it inftru&s the chemift \\nand the phyfician, may be ufefnl alfo to the naturalift and the \\nphilofopher, and even to the man of letters, by the interefl \\nwhich the author gives to a fubjedl that appears to be little, \\nfufceptible of it, and the variety of the details-which it con¬ \\ntains, It is to be wifhed that this grand enterprife, begun \\nby Bayen and Venel, had been continued ; but the funds fet \\napart for the execution of it having been applied to other \\nobjects, it was at laft dropped; and the knowledge refpedling \\nthe mineral waters of France is flill imperfect. \\nBayen, in the courfe of his travels through the Pyrenees,, \\nhad fiudied natural hiftory, and been convinced of the necef- \\nfity of analyfing bodies, in order to acquire a knowledge of \\nthe fubftances which compofe them. He therefore coiledfed \\nfpecimens of thofe minerals which feemed to be moil de¬ \\nfer ving of particular attention; and thefe fpecimens in his \\nhands became valuable materials for the ingenious analyfis \\nwhich he made of them, and in which he was employed for \\ntwelve years. To this immenfe labour the public is in-? \\ndebted for Bayen’s different memoirs on marble, Terpentines, \\nporphyry, ophites, granites, jafper, argillaceous fchifts, and \\nthe fparry ore of iron, which he prefen’ted to the Academy \\npf Sciences, and which that body caufed to be inferted among \\nthofe of the foreign literati. \\nStahl, the oracle of chemiftry, having maintained that one \\nof the efiential principles in nature is pure fire, or the mat¬ \\nter which produces fire in combuftible bodies, gave to this \\nelement thus combined the particular name of pblogiflon, or \\nthe inflammable prmciple. Bayen, who in Kll his operations \\nfought only for truth, and would not be convinced without \\nevident proofs, becaufe the habit of experience had rendered \\nhim miftruftful, began to doubt of the exiftence of phlogif- \\ntorn \\n', 'Biographical Memoirs of P. Baye?i\\\\ \\nton. He at firft communicated his doubts to fome friends, \\nand then to the celebrated Macquer, who did not approve \\nof them. The opinion of that learned man did not how¬ \\never difcourage him 5 and he continued his reiearcnes. It \\nwas chiefly by examining precipitates of mercury that Bayen \\nconvinced himfelf fully of the falfity of Stahl’s dodtrine, and \\nthat he acquired a proof that every thing called metallic oxyde \\nis indebted for the excefs of its weight, its colour, and its \\nftate, only to the abforption of one of the conftituent parts \\nof the atmofpheric air. With apparatus, which he invented, \\nhe made experiments fo rigoroufly correct, that he was able \\nto calculate the weight of this fubftance fixed in the metals. \\nWhen Bayen prefented to the Academy of Sciences the \\nrefult of the experiments above mentioned, Lavoifier, wh© \\nwras prefent, made metallic oxydes the objedt of his re- \\nfearches alfo. He repeated the experiments of Bayen ; found \\nthem corredl; difcovered that a portion of the air drawn \\nfrom metallic calces is much purer than that of the atmo- \\nfphere; that this portion is the only part which can ferve \\nfor combuftion and refpiration; and gave to this fluid the \\nname of vital air. Lavoifier therefore, by removing entirely \\nthe veil which Bayen had only drawn a little afide, over¬ \\nturned for ever the theory of Stahl, and eftablilhed one of \\nthe mo ft memorable epochs in chemiftry. \\nThe various experiments which Bayen made, in the courfe \\nof three years, on the precipitates of mercury, led him to a \\ndifcovery of the lingular property which lome of thefe pre¬ \\ncipitates have of exploding with a loud noife, when mixed \\nwith a very fmall quantity of the flowers of fulphur. Bayen s \\nlabours alfo in regard to tin ought not to be palled over in \\nfilence. It was a queftion in chemiftry, to determine whether \\nthat metal really contained arfenic, as Margraff and Henkel \\nhad faid ; and, fuppofing it did, whether the quantity would \\nbe lufftcient to make the ufe of it be abandoned in economi¬ \\ncal purpofes. The long and laborious refearches of Bayen \\ndifcoyered that there exifts tin without any mixture; and \\nP 4 that \\n', '0,1.6 Biographical Memoirs of P. Bayen. \\nthat there exiffs feme alfo, which is united to a very fmall \\nquantity of the arfenical fubfiance. \\nHis analvfes taught him alfo3 that the tin ufed in com¬ \\nmerce, and that manufa&ured by pewterers, contain copper \\nand antimony, which render it hard; zinc, which gives it \\na white colour; bifmuth, which renders it fonorous ; and, \\nabove all, lead, which diminifhes its value. It is in particular \\nthis metal fraudulently united with tin, that can render the \\nlatter dangerous as both thefe fubhances are foluble in \\nVegetable acids. Scarcely had Bayen’s refearches on tin been \\nmade pubhd, when the uneafinefs excited by MargrafF and \\nHenkel vanifhed. It was clearly proved, that the very fmall \\n.quantity- of arfenic contained in tin cannot abfolutely be \\nhurtful, and no more ideas were entertained of banifhing a \\nfpecies of veffels lo long employed by our anceftors. \\nBayen had fuch a habit of conhdering objects, and of \\njudging of their compofition by the analyfes he had made of \\nanalogous objeHs, that it was often fufficient for him to fee \\nand to touch them in order to tell their nature. As a proof \\nof this affection, may be mentioned the opinion which he \\ngave of one of the marble baluftrades in the Place de la Revo¬ \\nlution. Notwithstanding the polifh and apparent folidity of \\nthis marble, he foretold that it would decay in a very little \\ntime; and he pointed out to Deyeux, who was prefent, the \\ndifferent places where the alteration would firft manifefl it- \\nfelf, and thofe which would endure the longeft. Scarcely \\nhad a year elapfed when the prediction began to be accom- \\nplithed ; and in lefs than three years the alteration was fo \\ngreat, that confiderable excavations were formed in the \\nplaces pointed out. Bayen was of opinion, that the moniu \\n* The pewter pets in common ufe in London contain lead in their \\ncompofition ; and as all the beer drawn in them is more or lefs acid \\n(fale), it is evident that thofe who ufe them areconftantly takine though \\nin fmall quantities, a foiuticn of lead, which is highly noxious. It is \\nvery improper, therefore, to ufe beer which has food in them for any \\nlength of time. Edit. \\nm ents \\n', \"Biographical Memoirs of P. Bayen.

By thus making an ufeful \\napplication of chemiftry to an art which feemed to be foreign \\nto it* he revived a truth* too little noticed* that there exifts \\nbetween all the faiences a connection which unites them by \\nfixed and invariable principles. \\nBefides the labours above mentioned* Bayen began others* \\nwhich* on account of the many experiments neceffary before \\nhe could obtain certain relults, were never finifhed; for he \\nwas of opinion that the operations of chemiftry ought to be \\nconducted {lowly, like thofe of nature. On this account he \\nhas been known to employ himfelf whole years in the ex¬ \\namination of one fubfiance* in which he wifiied to dif- \\ncover and to feparate a matter* that would have been de¬ \\nft roved or altered by too violent means, had he proceeded \\nwith more hafte. To this prudent conduCt was owing the \\ngreat perfection to which he always carried his labours,; \\nand his accuracy was fo great, that he was never afraid of \\nfeeing his experiments repeated by other chemifts. \\nThis diligent and laborious man* when he had attained \\nto the age of fixtv, found his health* which had hitherto \\nbeen found and robuft* fenfibly impaired by a long and pain¬ \\nful malady. Several journeys which he was obliged to \\nundertake, the lofs of fome friends* domeftic troubles* and \\nweaknefs brought on by his labours* haftened his death.

The two faces \\nj •—J \\nof this fragment are inclined to each other about twelve \\ndegrees, and their greateft diltance is fourteen millimetres, \\nor a little more than fix lines. If this fragment be placed on \\na piece of paper on which a line has been drawn, two very \\ndiftindt images of the line are feen. By obferving objedts \\nfomewhat remote through this fragment, it may be judged, \\nby the diftancfe between the images, that the refradlion of \\nfulphur in itfelf mull be very confiderable, allowance being \\nmade for the denlity of that fubllance, the fpecific weight of \\nwhich is only double that of water ; and this agrees with the \\nrefults of Newton, in regard to the refradlive powers of in¬ \\nflammable bodies. Cit. Hauy propofes to make experiments \\nin order to determine the quantity of this refradlion, which. \\nn has \\n', \"%%% Arts. \\nhas not yet been meafured, and to compare it afterwards \\nwith the refult of calculation, according to the proportion \\n% \\nbetween the refractive powers of inflammable fubflances and \\ntheir denfities. \\n\\\\ ' , ARTS. \\nAN ingenious ArtiA at Paris has lately completed, with \\ngreat perfeverance, patience, and mathematical accuracy, \\na very curious model of that city, on which he has been \\nemployed nine years. He has not contented himfelf with \\ncomparing and correcting all the plans of Paris ever pub- \\nlifhed : he meafured all the Areets, fquares, &c. according to \\nthe moA accurate geometrical methods of meafurement, and \\ndetermined the inequalities of the fite of that immenfe capi¬ \\ntal by levelling. The greateft diameter of his model, in the \\nextent from eaA to weA, is fifteen feet. The mean fize of \\nthe houfes is three lines. The artiA has carried his accuracy \\nj \\nfo far, that each inhabitant of Paris can diAinguifli his own \\nhoufe, court-yard, and garden. The public places and gar¬ \\ndens are reprefented with a moA Ariking Amilitude; and not \\nonly their dimenAons but their colour and ornaments can be \\nobferved. The alternate riAng and falling of the plane of \\nthe model gives to this reprefentatiori a corre&nefs which \\nproduces an effeCt like enchantment, if the obferver fup- \\npofes himfelf to be Aanding on Mount-Marte, and to be \\nlooking down on the city. The artiA has with much judg¬ \\nment endeavoured, by the Aiades of his colours, to o-jve a \\n> O \\npoint of reA to the eye; the want of which is a great failing \\nin that model of Rome which formerly Aood in the library \\nof St. Genevieve, and which now belongs to the French \\nnation, as it exhibits the tirefome view of a dazzling white \\n.mafs of gypfum. Thirty thoufand trees, which diftinguifh \\nthe different walks, public places, and gardens, form an \\nagreeable variety with the flated and tiled roofs.

Thus, for example, \\nthe difcovery of animal plants pointed out the tranlition \\nfrom the vegetable to the animal kingdom. *1 he bat and \\nthe fiytng fquirrel difplayed the connection between qua¬ \\ndrupeds and birds; and the feal and the fea-cow that of \\nquadrupeds with fifhes. \\nThe greateft vacuity which appears to us in the plan of \\nnature is, certainly, that obferved between man, a being \\nendowed with reafon, and the irrational animals. Natural- \\nt—~ './y- \\nills hitherto have endeavoured, but in vain, by the mod ac¬ \\ncurate refearches to acquire fome fatisfadlion on this point 5 \\nand we may almoll confider it as certain that the links of \\nthe great chain, here wanting, are not to be found in the \\nworld which we at prefent inhabit. Were nothing more \\nrequired but fimilarity of bodily conformation, this tranfi- \\n^7°I- tioiq, \\n\", \"226 Dcfcription of the Orang Outang \\ntion, without doubt, would be found in the four-handed \\nrace of apes. But as the qualities of the mind are here as \\nmuch confidered as the form of the body, it is evident that \\nthe ape, which does not deferve the fecond rank among the \\nirrational animals, cannot form the link that connedfs qua¬ \\ndrupeds with man. The external figure, however, of this \\nanimal has fince the earlieft periods engaged the attention \\nof naturalifts ; and by the fimiiitude of its body we are led \\nto fufpedl a fimiiitude of mental powers in beings to which \\nthe all-wile Creator has given fo much likenefs. But as the \\ndifcoveries made by the fearchers into nature are frequent¬ \\nly not fo much the truth as fomething fuited to the fyftems \\nwhich they have adopted, this circumflance has given rife to \\na great deal of error. The celebrated Linnasus himfelf was \\ninduced by a figure which Bontius * delineated of an orang \\noutang, or wild man, feen in the ifland of Java, and the ac¬ \\ncounts of feme travellers, to clafs his homo noBurnus or night¬ \\nman between man and the ape, and thereby to eftablifh \\nthe existence of a being, the truth of which is as yet very- \\ndoubtful. \\nBuffon proceeded in a much more cautious manner. \\nThat celebrated naturalift fufpedled, and not without rea- \\nfon, that the accounts given with fo little accuracy of the \\n4 \\nnight-men alluded only to the white negroes or kakerlaks, \\nconfidered in a falfe light or under the veil of prejudice ; \\nand, indeed, the defeription given by Bontius of the orang \\noutang differs 'only in fome very inconfiderable circum- \\nftances from the figure of the white negro or kakerlak \\nSaudami deferibed by M. van Iperenf. If we take from this \\ndefeription of Bontius the ruff under the chin, and the few \\nhairs which cover the head, a more beautiful human form \\n* Bontius refiued as a phyfician at Batavia in the laft century, and \\nwrote Hijl.

Briflon, who clafTes \\nthe orang outang of Bontius along with the vari, appears to \\nhave been of the fame opinion. An inftance of fuch a falfe \\nand too human-like reprefentation of this animal occurs alfo \\nin the figure of an orang outang of the ifland of Borneo, \\ngiven in Beckman’s voyage *, where the author fpeaks, with¬ \\nout all doubt, of the fame fpecies as that tranfmitted to our \\nfociety from that ifland. But be this as it may, it is certain \\nthat fince the time Bontius refided in Java, or the middle of \\nthe lafl century, no orang outang, fuch as that delineated \\nby him, has been found either in this ifland or in any of \\nthofe in the neighbourhood $ and as he aiTerts that he faw \\nfeveral fuch animals of both fexes, it is certainly incompre- \\nhenfible why the leafl traces of them are not now to be dif- \\ncovered.

The ears are fmall, and lie flat to the head. The \\neyes are fmall and prominent. The nofe, without any per¬ \\nceptible elevation, conGfls merely of two long noflrils, placed \\nin an oblique direction towards each other. The mouth is \\nfurrounded by thick lips, and in the infide has no pouches \\n(zachen). The to-ngue is thick and broad.

The bread and the belly are \\nmofbly bare, ine other parts of the body, tire face, the \\nea.s, tile palms ox the hands, the feet and the fingers ex¬ \\ncepted, are covered with brown hair, which in many places \\nis fully as long as the finger. \\nUnder the fkin of the throat and bread of the animal \\ntranfmitced to the fociety, there were found two bags, one \\noi which occupied the greater part of the bread, and, as well \\nas the fmaller which was inclofed in it, had a communi¬ \\ncation with the wind-pipe.

Jordan. From Gottingifches \\nJournal der Naturwiffenfchaften, by J. F. GMELIN. \\n•Foil Part III 1798. \\nX J the courfe of my repeated tours through the Harz*, I \\namended the Broken twelve different times ; but I had the \\ngood fortune only twice (both times about Whitfuntide) to \\nfee that atmofpheric phenomenon called the Spedtre of the \\nBroken, which appears to me worthy of particular attention, \\nas it mufl, no doubt, be obferved on other high mountains \\nwhich have a fituation favourable for producing it. \\nThe fir ft time I was deceived by this extraordinary phe¬ \\nnomenon I had clambered up to the fummit of the Broken, \\nvery early in the morning, in order to wait there for the in- \\nexpreffibly beautiful view of the fun riling in the eaft. The \\nheavens were already (freaked with red ; the fun was juft \\nappearing above the horizon in full majefty, and the mod \\npei fe£t ferenity prevailed throughout the furrounding coun¬ \\ntry, when the other Harz mountains in the fouth-weft, to¬ \\nwards the Worm mountains, &c. lying under the Broken, \\nbegan to be* covered by thick clouds. Afcending at that \\nmoment the granite rocks called the Teufelskanzel, there ap¬ \\npeared before me, though at a great diffance, towards the \\nWorm mountains and the Achtermannshohe, the gigantic \\nfigure of a man, as if Handing on a large pedeftal. But \\nfcarcely had 1 difeovered it when it began to difappear j the \\nclouds funk down fpeedily and expanded, and I faw the \\nphenomenon no more. \\nThe fecond time, however, I faw this fpedfre fomewhat \\nmore diflindlly, a little below the fummit of the Broken, and \\nnear the Heinrichshobe, as I was looking at the fun rifing \\nabout four o’clock in the morning. The weather was ra¬ \\nther tempefluous ; the fky towards the level country was \\n* The Harz mountains are fituated in Hanover. . \\npretty \\n', \"Qbfervations on a fingular Phenomenon, 233 \\npretty clear, but the Harz mountains had attracted feveral \\nthick clouds, which had been hovering around them, and \\nwhich beginning to fettle on the Broken confined the pro- \\nfpect. In thefe clouds, foon after the riling of the fun, I \\nfaw my own fhadow, of a monftrous fize, move itfelf for a \\ncouple of fecon s exactly as I moved ; but I was foon in¬ \\nvolved in clouds, and the phenomenon difappeared. \\nIt is impoflible to fee this phenomenon, except when the \\nfun is at fuch an altitude as to throw his rays upon the body \\nin a horiz mtal direction \\\\ for, if he is higher, the fhadow is \\nthrown rather under the body than before it. \\nIn the month of September laft year, as I was making a \\ntour through the darz with a very agreeable party, and af» \\ncended the Broken, I found an excellent account and expla¬ \\nnation of this phenomenon, as feen by M. Haue on the 23d \\nof May 1797, in his diary ot an excurfion to that mountain. \\nI thall therefore take the liberty of tranferibing it. “ After \\nhaving been here for the thirtieth time,'’ fays M. Haue, \\n“and, befides other objeds of my attention, having procur¬ \\ned information refpeding the above-mentioned atmofpheric \\nphenomenon, I was at length fo fortunate as to have the \\npleafure of feeing it; and perhaps my defeription may afford \\nfatisfadion to others who vifit the Broken through curiofity. \\nThe fun rofe about four o’clock, and, the atmolphere being \\nqui e ferene towards the eaft, his rays could pafs without any \\nobftrudion over the Heinrichshohe. In the fouth-weft, how¬ \\never, towards AchtCrmannshohe, a brifk weft wind carried \\nbefore it thin tranfparent vapours, which were not yet con- \\ndenfed into thick heavy clouds. \\n“ About a quarter paft four I went towards the inn, and \\nlooked round to fee whether the atmofphere would permit \\nme to have a free profped to the fouth-weft; when I ob- \\nferved, at a very great diftance towards Achtermannshohe, \\na human figure of a monftrous fize. A violent guft of wind \\nhaving almoft carried away my hat, I clapped my hand to it \\nby \\n\", '234- Observations on a fingular Phenomenon. \\nby moving my arm towards my head, and the coloflal figurq \\ndid the fame. \\n“ The pleafure which I felt on this difcovery can hardly be \\ndefcribed ; for I had already walked many a weary ftep in \\nthe hopes of feeing this fhadowy image, without being able \\nto gratify my curiofity. I immediately made another move^ \\nment by bending my body, and the coloflal figure before me \\nrepeated it. I was defirous of doing the fame thing once \\nmore—but my coloffus had vanifhed.

An Account of Mr, Park's Journey into the Interior \\nParts of Africa. From the Proceedings of the African \\nAffociation, 1798. \\n[Concluded from Page 204.] \\nTh E city of Sego, at which Mr. Park had now arrived, \\nIponfifted of four divifions or quarters, two on each fide of \\nthe water; and each of them being furrounded by a mud \\nwall, it had the appearance of four diftincf towns. The \\nhoufes are built of clay, and have flat roofs; but fome of \\nthem have two dories, and many are white-wafhed. Be- \\nfides thefe buildings, Moorifh mofques are feen in every \\nquarter. Thefe objedfs, with the numerous boats on the \\nriver, a crowded population, and the cultivated Hate of the \\nfurrounding country, formed altogether a profpedt of civi- \\nlifation and magnificence which our traveller little expedfed \\nto find in the bofom of Africa. From the bed inquiries he \\ncould make, he had reafon to believe that the place contained \\naltogether about 30,000 inhabitants. \\nThe boats on the Niger are formed of the trunks of two \\nlarge trees rendered concave, and joined together, not fide \\nby fide, but lengthways, the jundtion being exadfly acrofs \\nthe middle of the boat. They are therefore very long, and \\ndifproportionably narrow 5 and have neither decks nor mads: \\nthey are however roomy. Mr. Park obferved in one of them \\nfour horfes and a great many people eroding at a ferry. \\nTo this ferry Mr. Park proceeded, intending to crofs \\nover to the largeft quarter of the city, where he was in- \\niormed the king of Bambara held his refidence; but the \\nnumber of people prefling for a paflfage was fuch as to pre¬ \\nvent his embarkation. \\nThe \\n\", \"235 Mr. Park's Journey Into Africa. \\nThe multitude gazed on the flranger with filent wonder; \\nand he diftinguifhed with concern many Moors among them. \\nIn the mean time, information that a white man was waiting \\nfor a paflage was conveyed to the king; who immediately \\nfent a meflenger to inquire what brought him to Sego, and \\nwhat he wanted ? Our traveller, having given the bed an- \\nfwer he could as to the motives of his journey, added, that \\nhe was there in his way to Jenne, and, having been robbed \\nof all he poffefled, implored the king’s bounty and protec¬ \\ntion. The meffenger told him to go to a diflant village, \\nwhich he pointed out, and wait for the king’s farther orders. \\nMr. Park complied with thefe diredlions, but found that \\nthe inhabitants of the village were either averfe or afraid to \\ngive him lodging or entertainment; and having turned his \\nhorfe loofe, he fought fheher from a dorm of thunder and \\nrain under a tree. At length, as night approached, the kind- \\nnefs and humanity inherent in the female fex, to which he \\nhad often been indebted on former occafio.ns, came to his \\nrelief on tne prefent. A poor negro woman returning from \\nthe labours of the neld obferved that Ire was wet, weary \\nand deje&ed, and, taking up his faddle and bridle, told him \\nto follow her. She led him to her cottage, lighted up a \\nlamp, procured him an excellent fupper of frfh, and plenty \\noi corn ror his horfe; after which, (Ire fpread a mat upon \\nthe floor, and faid he might remain there for the night. \\nTor this well-timed bounty our traveller prefented her with \\ntwo of the four brafs buttons which remained on his waift- \\ncoat, Mr. Park relates that this good woman, having per¬ \\nformed the rites of hofpitality herfelf, called in the female \\npart of her family, and made them fpin cotton for a great \\npart of the night. They lightened their labour by longs : \\none of which muft have been compofed extempore; for our \\ntraveller was himfelf the lubjeff of it; and the air was, in \\nhis opinion, the fweeteft and moll plaintive he had ever \\nheaid. The words, as may be expedfed, were fimple, and \\nmay be literally tranllated as follows : “ The winds roared, \\nand \\n\", \"Mr. Park's 'Journey into Africa. 237 \\nand the rain fell. The poor white man, faint and weary, \\ncame and fat under our tree. lie has no mother to bring \\nhim milk—no wife to grind his corn.”-Chorus. “ Let \\nus pity the white man ; no mother has he, &c. &c.” \\nMr. Park continued all the next day in the village, with¬ \\nout receiving any orders from the king, and found himfelf \\nthe object of universal inquiry. He loon heard enough, \\nhowever, to convince him, that the Moors and Slatees or \\nhave traders, redding in Sego, were exceedingly fufpicious \\nconcerning the motives of his journey, and in the higheft \\ndegree hoftile towards him. Pie learnt that many confulta* \\ntions had been held with the king concerning his reception \\nand difpofal; and the villagers openly told him that he had \\nmany enemies, and rnuH expect no favour. \\nOn the third day the mellenger arrived ; and, bringing a \\nbag in his hands, dignified to our traveller that he muft de¬ \\npart forthwith from the vicinage of Sego ; but that Manfong \\nthe king, wifhing to relieve a white man in diftrefs, had \\nfent him 50CO kowries * to enable him to purchafe provi- \\nfions in the courfe of his journey. The meffenger added, \\nthat if Park's intentions were really to proceed to Jenne, he \\nhad orders to accompany him as a guide to Sanfanding. \\nBeing thus compelled to leave Sego, Mr. Park applied \\nhimfelf to colled! all the information he could from his \\nguide. Though it was evident, that this man was fent prin¬ \\ncipally in the view of difcovering the motives and objed! of \\nhis journey, he was found to be very friendly and commu¬ \\nnicative. By him Mr. Park was frankly told, that if Jenne \\nwas the place of his dedication, he had undertaken an en- \\nterprife of greater danger than probably he was apprifed \\nof j for, although the town of Jenne was nominally a part \\nof the king of Bambara’s dominions, it was in fad! a city of \\n* Kowries or cowries are fmall ihells which in.

It is fituated in the midft of a beautiful and \\nhighly cultivated country, <s bearing,” fays Mr. Park, cs a \\ngreater refemblance to the centre of England, than to what \\nI fhould have fuppofed had been in the middle of Africa f \\nand the feafon was that of the foea harveft, or the gathering \\nin the fruit which produces the foea-toulou or tree-butter, \\nthe great abundance of which in this quarter was aftonifli- \\ning. The tree itfelf very much refembles the American \\noak ; and the nut, from the kernel of which the butter is \\nprepared by boiling it in water, has fomewhat the appear¬ \\nance of a Spanifh olive. The kernel is enveloped in a fweet \\npulp under a thin green rind ; and it is Mr. Park’s opinion, \\nthat the butter produced from it, befides the advantage of \\nits keeping without fait the whole year, is whiter, firmer, \\nand of a richer flavour than the bed butter he ever tailed \\nmade from cow’s milk. T. he growth and preparation of \\nthis commodity feem to be among the firft objeCts of African \\ninduftry in this and the neighbouring dates ; and it confti- \\ntutes a main article of their inland commerce. \\nOn the afternoon of the fecond day Mr. Park and his \\nguide reached Sanfanding, a very large town fituated on the \\nbanks of the Niger, much reforted to by the Moors, who \\nbring thither large quantities of fait, which they barter for \\njhea \\n', \"Mr. Park's Journey into Africa. 239 \\njhea toulou and gold dull. Leaving this place early next \\nmorning, he proceeded to a town called Nyara, and from \\nthence to Modibao, a delightful place on the banks of the \\nriver, which is here very broad, and enlivened with many \\nfmall and verdant illands, all of them flocked with cattle \\nand crowded with villages. Here he was compelled to fet \\noff again abruptly, for fear of the Moors, the dooty or chief \\nman giving him a guide to Kea ; but his horfe, which had \\nbeen long reduced to a mere fkeleton, dropped on the road, \\nand he was obliged to quit him. At Kea he embarked in a \\nfifliing canoe, and was landed in fix hours at Silla, a large \\ntown on the fouthern fide of the Niger* At this place the \\ndooty was nearly as favage as the Moors, and it was with \\ngreat difficulty our traveller could get fhelter for the night. \\nHe was now convinced by painful experience, that the ob-^ \\nhades to liis farther progrefs were infurmountable, and that \\nin attempting to reach Jenne, unlefs under the protection of \\nfome men of weight and influence among the Moors, which \\nhe had no poffible means of obtaining, he fhould facrifice \\nhimfelf to no purpofe ; for his difcoveries would perifh with \\nhim. He confidered at the fame time, that by returning to \\nGambia in a different route, he might flill promote in fome \\ndegree the purpofe of his miffion ; for, having difcovered the \\nNiger at a great diftance from its head, he fhould be adding \\nconfiderably to the geography of Africa, in tracing this mvf- \\nterious river Up the flream to its fource. On thefe' and fimilar \\nconfiderations Mr. Park determined to return to Sego, and, \\nproceeding from thence along the banks of the river, truft \\nfor his fupport to the hofpitality of the negroes in the fouth¬ \\nern ffates, out of the reach of Moorifh fanaticifm and malice. \\nThe town of Silla, from which Mr. Park began his return \\nhomewards, is within two fhort days journey of jenne,, \\nwhich is fituated on an iflarid in the river. At the diftance \\nof two days more the river empties itfelf into a confiderable \\n•lake, called Dibbieorthe Dark Lake 5 concerning the extent \\nof \\n\", \"2^0 Mr, Park's Journey into Africa, \\nof which, all the information which could be obtained was, \\nthat in eroding over it from wed; to ead the canoes' lofe \\nlight of land one whole day.

Sego in his'way back to Gambia ; \\nand at Modibao he had the good fortune to recover his \\nhorfe, which he found fomewhat improved in conditidn. \\nHere he learnt that Munfong, having been perfuaded by the \\nMoors that our traveller had come into his country with \\nfome mifchlevous intention, had given orders to apprehend \\nhim. He therefore thought it prudent to avoid Sego alto¬ \\ngether ; which he accordingly did, by taking a circuitous \\nroute until he. had got confiderably to the wed ; when turn¬ \\ning towards the Niger, he palled through many towns and \\nvillages on its banks ; the larged of which, called Sammee, \\nhe left on the 14th of Augud, and lodged that- night at \\nBenni.

On the following day he pro¬ \\nceeded to iVJarraboo, and in two days more arrived at Bam- \\nmakoo, the frontier of the kingdom of Bambara. \\nDuring the courfe of this peregrination through the king \\nof Bambara’s dominions, our traveller had to encounter the \\ntropical rains in all their violence ; and he was principally \\nindebted for his daily fupport to the dooty or chief man in \\nthe feveral towns through which he palled. This officer \\nfeems to poffefs in fome refpedts the authority of mayor in \\nthe corporate towns of England; and it refledfs great ho¬ \\nnour on the police of the African kingdoms, or on the be¬ \\nnevolent manners of the natives, that it is confidered one \\npart of the dooty’s obligation to provide food for the necef- \\nfitous traveller : — fujfer the king's flranger to depart hun- \\ngry> fuch is the phrafe ufed, is an offence of a very heinous \\nnature. On many occafions Mr. Park offered payment, for \\nwhat he received, out of the kowries that ftili remained of \\nthe king’s prefent, and his offer was fometimes accepted, \\nand fometimes refufed. On others he remunerated his hoft \\nin a fingular manner, the particulars of which deferve to be \\nrecited. Among the various impoflures pra<Tifed by the \\nMoors towards the poor negroes, they frequently fell them \\nferaps of paper with an Arabic infeription (commonly a paf- \\nfage from the Koran), which are called faphies or charms. \\nYvrith one of thefe about his perfon, the poffeffor confiders \\nhimfelf invulnerable, and neither the lurking ferpent nor \\nthe prowling leopard is any longer the objedl of his dread. \\nIn the circumftances to which Mr. Park was reduced, he had \\nthe good fortune to difeover that the negro natives aferibed \\nto him the power of granting faphies of even more than \\nArabian virtue* u If a Moor’s faphie is good,’* faid the \\ndooty of Sanfanding, a a white man’s mull be better*,” and \\nMr. Park, at his requeft, gave him one poffeffed of all the \\nvirtues he could concentrate, for it contained the Lord’s \\ntrayer.

In \\nhis journey weftward this merchandize turned to extraordi¬ \\nnary good account; and it is furelv needlefs for Mr. Park \\nto frame any apology for having availed himlelf of fuch a \\nrefource in his fituation. \\nAt Bammakoo the Niger ceafcs to be navigable. It takes \\nits rife at a fmall village called Sankari in the high lands of \\nJallonkondoo, about fix days journey S. W. from Bamma¬ \\nkoo; and the country becoming mountainous, our traveller \\non the 22d took the path for Sibidooloo, where he arrived \\nat the end of two days. On the 30th he came to Wonda, a \\nfine village regularly built and furrounded by a wall. Here \\nhe was confined feveral days by ficknefs; and having no¬ \\nthing elfe to offer to the friendly negro, in whofe houfe he \\nwas accommodated, Mr.Park prefented him, at parting, with \\nhis horfe, now indeed become unable to proceed any farther. \\nOn the 8th of September he fet out on foot for Kinneyeto, \\na confiderable town, which he reached on the nth, and in \\nthree days more arrived at Kamalia. At this place Mr. \\nPark, worn down by fatigue 2nd the vieiiTitudes of the wea¬ \\nther, having fometimes been plunged up to the neck in ri¬ \\nvers and fwamps, and fometimes loft in woods and deferts, \\nwithout fhelter, clothing, or food, fell into a fevere and dan¬ \\ngerous fit of ficknefs, in which the remembrance of paft fuf- \\nfering, and the hopes of future enjoyment, had nearly been \\nex tin gui (lied together. On his arrival at Kamalia he had \\nflill a fpace of 500 miles to traverfe before he could reach \\nany friendly country on the Gambia ; and being informed \\nthat great part of the way lay through a defert, which it \\nwas impoflible he could crofs fingly and unfupported, he \\nhad no other refource but to wait for the firft caravan of \\nfiaves that might travel the fame track. Such a one was \\nexpelled to pafs through Kamalia at the end of three months, \\nand the chief director of it refided in that place. To him, \\ntherefore, Mr. Park applied ; and for the value of one Have, \\nto \\n\", \"Ivir.

Under this man’s roof our traveller was con¬ \\nfined to a mat, which was his only bed, by a fevere and dan¬ \\ngerous fever for upwards of a month. Five months longer \\nhe was detained for the caravan. During this long interval \\nnot a murmur efcaped the lips of Karfa, or of any of his \\nwives, at the trouble and expence which their inmate brought \\nupon them. To the kind attentions, the tender folicitude, \\nthe cheerful affiduity, and warm hofpitality of thefe poor \\nPagans, Mr. Park declares he is indebted not only for his \\nfafe return to Great Britain, but alfo for the prefervation \\nof his life; and he admits that he made his friend Karfa but \\nan inadequate return, though the bell in his power, by pre- \\nfencing him, on their arrival at Gambia, with double the fum \\nthat he had originally promifed. \\nThe whole of Mr. Park’s route, both in going and re¬ \\nturning, having been confined to a tra£l of country bounded \\nnearly by the 12th and 15th parallels of latitude, it mufl be \\nimagined that he found the climate in all places exceedingly \\nhot. On the borders of the defert, where the fiercenefs of \\nthe tropical fun is remedied from the fands, the heat was \\nfcarcely fupportable. Having been robbed of his thermo¬ \\nmeter, he had no means of forming a comparative judg¬ \\nment *, but he well remembers that in the dry feafon, when \\nthe wind blows from the eaft and north-eaft acrofs the de- \\niert, the ground became fo hot in the middle of the day as \\nnot to be borne by the naked foot. In the camp at Benowm \\neven the negro flaves, accullomed as they were to this tem¬ \\nperature, could not walk from one tent to another without \\ntheir fandals. At this time of the day the Moors lie flretched \\nat length in their tents, either afleep or unwilling to move; \\nand Mr. Park declares, that, as he lay liillefsly along after \\ntheir manner in his hut of reeds, he could not hold his hand \\nR2 _ again ft \\n\", '244 Air.

During the \\nrainy feafon the prevailing wind is from the fouth-weft. \\nThe monfoon commonly changes about the latter end of \\nJune, and the wind continues to blow from the fouth-weft \\nquarter until the middle or end of OTober. In this inter¬ \\nval the country is flooded, and the rains are preceded and \\nfollowed by dreadful tornadoes or typhons. The com¬ \\nmencement of this monfoon is the fpring or feed-time, and \\nits termination is commonly the feafon of harveft. \\nAmong the principal productions of the negroe territories \\nis the lotus. It is rather a thorny fhrub than a tree, and \\nabounds in all the countries which Mr. Park traverfed ; but \\nit thrives beft in a fandy foil. Its fruit is a fmall yellow fa¬ \\nrinaceous berry, about the fize of an olive, which being \\npounded in a wooden vefTel, and afterwards dried in the fun, \\nis made into excellent cakes refembling in colour and fla- \\n&j* \\nvour the fweeteft gingerbread. Some of the natives pre¬ \\npare from it alfo a liquor delicioufly fweet. \\nOf one fpecies of their corn the negroes make excellent \\nbeer, by malting the feeds nearly in the fame manner as \\nbarley is malted in England ; and the beer which is thus \\nmade was to Mr. Park’s tafte equal to the beft ftrong beer \\nhe had ever drank in his native country. \\nIn the latter end of April 1797 the cojfie or caravan being \\nat length completed, and our traveller’s health re-eftablifhed, \\nhe fet out from Kamalia in company with feventy perfons, \\nof whom only thirty-feven were Haves for fale.

I he \\nfan of the inventor, now in London, has published a fmall \\nwork on the fubjeef, to introduce it to the notice of medical \\nmen in this country, from which we extract the following \\nparticulars : \\nGalvani, the celebrated profeflbr at bologna, was the \\nfirfb who announced fome curious phenomena, obferved \\nfrom an acciden al application of metallic fubftances to the \\nnerves and mufcles of animals. The fubjedl immediately \\nengaged the attention of philofophers throughout Europe, \\nand the public, in confequence, were foon favoured with a \\nconfirmation of Galvani’s affertions, by the publication of \\nthe experiments of Valli, Volta, Fowler, Monro, Cavallo, \\nSee. The refult of thefe various refearches proved that \\nthe influence is not peculiar to a few animals only, but \\nfeems to be a property of all.” Although the living animal \\n'is moil fufceptible of the influence, yet, from a combination \\nof different metals, the nerves and mufcular fibres, long \\nafter every appearance of vitality was removed, have been \\nexcited to powerful a£Hon. \\nFrom the difeovery of a new law % adding fo important a \\npart in the animal oeconomy, it might rationally be expedred \\nthat attempts would be made to afeertain how far this prin¬ \\nciple could be applied in a remedial point of view to human \\ndifeafes. This has been the particular enquiry of Dodlor \\nPerkins. \\n* The term animal electricity, which arofe from the many ana¬ \\nlogies that were obferved between the influence difeovered by Galvani \\nand eleffricity, has by later writers given place to GALVANISM, a com¬ \\npliment well merited by the ingenious difeoverer. \\nSevers* \\n\", \"Influence of Metallic Trailers * 251 \\nSeveral phenomena relating to the influence of metals in \\ncafes of pains, he had obferved before the news of Galvani's \\ndifeoveryhad reached America*, and when the phyfiologifts \\nof f urope were engaged in experimenting on the denuded \\nnerves and mufcles of the fmaller animals, with a view to \\nafeertain the agency of this incomprehenfible property in \\nthem, Dr. Perkins was profecuting a feries of experiments, \\nwhich confided in applying externally, to parts affcdled with \\ndifeafe, metals and compounds of metals, of every deferip- \\ntion, which occurred to him, and conftrudted into various \\nforms and fizes.

A well is funk \\nabout 24 feet deep. In the courfe of this depth there is a \\ntock the thicknefs oi 8 or 10 feet; afterwards a bed of \\nmarl; after penetrating which, another rock, much harder \\nthan the former, is found. Through this fecond rock a bore \\nis made 18 feet deep, where there is a fmall cleft in the \\nrock. There are many little fprings found in this coi rfe; \\n7 but \\n\", '256 An Anahfis of tw& Mineral Springs \\ni \\nbut from this cleft the water rifes with violence to the level \\nof 4 feet above the furface of the ground ; and it affords a \\nconftant and copious fupply of frefh water. \\nI. ON THE GASEOUS FLUIDS. \\nThe water, when frelh drawn, fmells of fulphurated \\nhydrogen, or hepatic # gas \\\\ but it quickly becomes inodor¬ \\nous by expofure to the atmofphere. I have obtained no \\nmore than 4 cubic inches of gafeous fluid from a wine- \\ngallon of the water. Of thefe, hardly half a cubic inch is \\nabforbed by the water \\\\ and, 1. Nitric acid dropped into this \\nfolution caufes a minute precipitate of fulphur \\\\ hence fome \\nhepatic gas has been expelled by the boiling. 2. I put fome \\nof the water, which had not been boiled, into a bottle, leav¬ \\ning a part of the bottle empty: I then filled the bottle en¬ \\ntirely with lime-water, and flopped it. A white precipitate \\nfell, which, with the addition of diflilled vinegar, effervefced \\nfenfibly, but not flrongly. 1 he half cubic inch is, therefore, \\nmoflly carbonic acid. 3. Into the portion of the air which \\nwas not abforbed by water, I plunged a lighted candle ; it \\nwas inflantly extinguifhed. This portion is,* therefore, \\nazotic gas. \\nII. THE SPONTANEOUS PRECIPITATE. \\nA fediment falls to the bottom, and adheres to the lide3 \\nof the bath. It is of a yellow colour, and acquires additional \\nbrightnefs by expofure to the atmofphere. A fimilar fedi¬ \\nment may be feparated by boiling the frefh water. From a \\ngallon of v/ater, .75 of a grain is procured. This diffolves \\nreadily in acids, and fhews all the common and well known \\nappearances of oxyd of iron. It muff have been united with \\nthe carbonic acid, which has been already detedled.

A piece of fulphate of argill was dropped into a jar oi \\nthe fame water ; prefently a flratum of white matter was \\nformed at the bottom of the jar : but this appearance is tran- \\nfitory ; for in the courfe of an hour or two the precipitate is \\nre-diffolved, and the water refumes its tranfparency. This \\nis an appearance which I had not found noticed by writers \\non the frrbjecV, though I have reafon to think it not uncom¬ \\nmon. The waters of Aftrop, near Banbury, contain car- \\nbonat of lime diffolved by the carbonic acid : and, when \\nthe carbonat has been feparated, by boiling the water, the \\nfame appearance is produced by fulphate of argill. Its \\norigin, and that of the decompofition of the mercurial fait, \\nwill be (hewn in the fequeh \\nIV.

Lead \\nalfo I have found to be a£led upon. \\nI examined, with fome minutenefs, the precipitates- formed \\nby iron and by copper. 2. The firft is of a yellow colour $ \\nand, though it is not magnetic, it may be made fo by the \\nflame of a blow-pipe upon charcoal. It conflfts, therefore, \\nof oxyde of iron, either totally or in part; but whether it is \\nderived from the liquor, or from the iron which was ufed to \\nprocure it, cannot be determined by this experiment. But \\nthe following obfervation demenftratres, that iron is contained \\nin the water itfelf. 3. The water was boiled in a copper \\nveffel, and the precipitate formed was collected. This is \\nalfo of a yellow colour > and, expofed to the flame of a blow¬ \\npipe on charcoal (like the former precipitate), it became \\nmagnetic. It feems alfo to contain copper *, for, precipitating \\nits folution in muriatic acid by ammoniac, the liquor became \\nblue \\\\ the colour however was by no means ftrong. \\n\"When the falts of the water have been concentrated by \\nevaporation, copper is acted upon more powerfully; in fo \\nmuch that if a filver fpcon be ufed for the evaporation it is \\nmuch tarnifhed, and the falls acquire a cupreous tafte and a \\nyellow tinge, though they are colourlefs if the evaporation \\nbe made in glafs.

MANGANESE IS DISSOLVED IN THIS WATEk. \\nAs zinc is known to have a ftronger affinity to acids than \\nthe other metals have, I hoped by its mean to obtain fome \\ninformation on the caufe of the fadls I have defcribed. 1. I \\nboiled, therefore, fome of the water in a glazed veffel, in \\nConta£t with fome pieces of zink : a fmall precipitate was \\nformed, but enough to be collected for examination with \\nthe blow-pipe. T his was fufed With borax ; and a globule \\nwas formed oi a rich red colour, precifely that communi¬ \\ncated by manganefe*. Continuing the fufion, the colour \\nvanifned ; nor could I make it re-appear by the yellow \\nflame of the blaft: probably becaufe the manganefe was \\nmixed with another metal. The globule was removed to a \\nfilver fpoon ; and, then, by fufion, it regained the red co¬ \\nlour. To avoid the poffibility of error, a little manganefe, \\nfuied with borax in the fame manner, was placed befide the \\nred globule; and no difference could be obferved in the co¬ \\nlour of the two globules, except a flight variety in the in- \\ntennty 2.

By ufiftgf \\na large quantity of the water, I collected fufficienf for exa= \\nmination. This I put over a fire on an iron plate: the ve¬ \\ngetable part took fire and burnt away : the powder became \\nof an cchry yellow, and was magnetic :—-fufed with borax \\nby the blow-pipe, it acquired the rednefs which manganefe \\nimparts. \\n3. The fame fabl may be proved by a-fingle experiment. \\nIt is known that tartrite of pot-afih docompofes falts of man¬ \\nganefe by a double affinity ; in confequence of which, tar¬ \\ntrite of manganefe, which is a fubftance infoluble in wa~ \\nter, precipitates *. I poured, therefore, a folution of tar¬ \\ntrite of pot-alh into water, and there fell a copious crystalline \\nprecipitate. Much iron fell down with the manganefe, as \\nmight be expected from the affinity between the oxydes of' \\nthefe metals: for, by fufing the precipitate with nitre, green \\nfpots were formed on the fides of the crucible. \\nTartrite of pot-afh decompofes likewife falts of lime, a& \\nis well known; but the tartrite of lime is precipitated in \\nthe form of a white powder, wdiich is not fenfibiy cryftaliine. \\nBut as there is a great abundance of lime in this water \\n(xiv.), it feems probable that it had entered into the com- \\npofition of thefe cry.ftals. \\nManganefe has been bqt rarely noticed as entering into' \\nthe compofition of mineral waters. The reafon, perhaps, is, \\nthat it has been feldom looked for, rather than that it feldonr \\nexifts; fince it is now known-to be a fubftance abundantly \\ndiffufed through the earth. The waters of Aftrop, which I* \\nhave mentioned above (in; 2.), decompofe tartrite of pot¬ \\nato, and form a cryftalline precipitate when its carbonate of \\nlime has been thrown down by boiling. This water, in' \\nthefe circumftances, hardly affeels either tindlure of galls or \\nfides that I tkferibe only what I have feen, it will appear that the ia \\nqueftion is of fo peculiar a nature, that'it cannot be expefted to obey the \\nufual analogies of the other foiutions. \\n# See Scheelc as above. \\npruSiat \\n\", '2 6l \\n*■ at Lemington Priors. \\nprufiiat of pat-afh.

AN HYPOTHESIS TC EXPLAIN THE CAUSE OF THE \\nPHENOMENA. \\nThe firfl hypothefis which I framed, to account for the \\nfadts in queftion, was deduced from the well-known pro¬ \\nperty which manganefe poffefles of oxygenating the muriatic \\nacid. My reafoning was as follows :—Since, during the \\nfolution of the black oxyde of manganefe in the muriatic \\nacid, a portion of the acid becomes oxygenated, it muft fol¬ \\nlow, that, if this portion ihould meet and combine with a \\nmetallic oxyde, the fait formed by fuch an union mull be \\nfuperoxygenated. But in the (late of oxy,elation, doubtlefs, \\nis a great part of the iron which is fo abundantly diffused \\nthrough the earth. Are -then the appearances in queftion \\nthe refuIt of thefe circumftances ? In fhort, are die halts \\nmuriat of manganefe and oxygenated muriat of iron ? *n \\npurfuance of this idea I formed fome oxygenated muria of \\nS 3 irona \\n', \"I \\n262 An Analyfis of two Mineral Springs \\niron, by mixing fome yellow oxyde of iron (the rubigo ferti \\nof the {hops) with water, and expofing it, by a proper appa* \\nratus, to the oxygenated muriatic acid gas.

THE APPEARANCES IN QUESTION ARE PRODUCED \\nBY THE ACTION OF HEPATIC GAS ON IRON AND MAN- \\nGANESli. \\nAn obfervation of Bergman, though in part erroneous, \\nhas condu&ed me, as I think, to the true caufe of thefe ap¬ \\npearances ; and I am greatly miftaken if its confequences, \\nwhen fully purfued, are not of confiderable importance to \\nchemical fcience. Bergman has afierted that hepatifed water \\nin which iron filings have been kept for fome days, in a well- \\nclofed veile!, grows purple with tinaure of galls : if tne iron \\nbe diffolved by an acid, the colour approaches more to violet* \\nHe moreover adds, that the Solution of iron in hepatifed wa¬ \\nter is rot at all rendered turbid by pruffiat of potafo (bergman - \\n.Effaysy Difertation vii. 4. L.) This latter fad promifed to \\nthrow fome light on the fubje£l of my enquiry, particularly \\nwhen it was joined to the iaa of the hepatic fmeil, which \\nthe water has when recently drawn (i.). I was the more \\nftrongly induced to pay attention to this combination, from \\nthe contradiction of another very eminent chemifl. Mr. \\nKirwan has denied that hepatic gas can difiolvc iron, or any \\nother metal (Philofoph» Tranfac. 1786). To aicertain this \\npoint, I have made numerous experiments with the greateft \\ncaution and accuracy that I have been able to apply. The \\nhepatic gas which I have ufed, was obtained irom fulphuret \\nof iron, formed by fufing equal parts of iron and flowers pi \\nfulphur ) and (except in fome inflances, which will oe par¬ \\nticularly noticed as they occur) was extricated by diluted \\nfulphuric acid. The gas was collected under water; which \\njjpae.thod was preferred, to purify it il poflible from extraneous \\nS 4 acid. \\n', \"An Analyfn of two Mineral Springs \\nacid. i. I digefte 1 iron filings, previoufiy purified by !*£« \\npeated wafhings with diftilled water, in a folution of hepatic \\ngas in diftihed water : the bo' tie was filled with the folution* \\nand corked. I he iron was prelently a£led upon ; numerous \\nbubbles arofe, which drove the cork out of the bottle ; they \\nwere ftrongly inflammable, and probably, therefore, pure \\nhydrogen gas: the liquor gradually loft its hepatic odour; \\nand at the end of fome days it had a fmell a good deal re- \\nfembling that of ftagnant rain wrater ; as the bubbles ceafed \\nto be produced it recovered its tranfparency. The liquor \\nwas then examined by re-agents. Infufion of galls {truck a \\nyellow tinge •, pruftiat of potafh gave a little whitifh cloud \\nnitrate of filver and muriat of barytes, each very minute pre¬ \\ncipitates ; pure potafh a yellow precipitate, but not till the \\nliquor had flood an hour or two. T. he liquor does not de- \\npofl.t any thing, either by expofure to the atmofphere or by \\na boding heat: but by this laid procefs fomething, perhaps \\na little gas which has efcaped the a61 ion of the iron, flies \\noff; fince the precipitate with nitrat of fllver was white af¬ \\nter the boiling, which had previous to it been black. Very \\nlittle can be deduced with certainty from thefe trials, except \\nthe prefence of a little fulphuric acid. It feemed of confe- \\nquence to determine whether this is generated in the pro¬ \\ncefs, or is accidental from the fulphuric acid which was \\nufed to extricate the gas. \\n2. To determine this point I repeated the experiment, \\nufing the muriatic acid to ^generate the gas, inftead of the \\nfulphuric. In this cafe, the liquor, as Pergman has faid, is \\niiot at all rendered turbid by pruftiat of potafh ; neither does \\nthe muriat of barytes precipitate any thing : the precipitate \\nby pure potafh is now white, but as minute as before : ni¬ \\ntrat of filver makes a yellow cloud both before and after \\nboiling : infufion of galls ftrikes a yellow tinge. Hence it \\nis clear, that hepatic gas, when produced by fulphuric acid, \\ncarries with it a little of the acid which cannot be feparated \\nby palling it through water. It feems probable alfo, that a \\nlittle \\n\", \"■at Lemington Priors. \\nlittle muriatic acid is carried up in like manner when this is \\nyfed to extricate the hepatic gas. We may farther conclude, \\nthat though the remark ot' Bergman on the effedl of the \\nprufliat of potafh is true ; the remark which accompanies it \\n(on the colour produced by infuflon of galls) is erroneous. \\nA purple colour is always, I believe, occafioned by extra¬ \\nneous acid; in which cafe the prufliat of potafh is alfo pre¬ \\ncipitated. From the fame fadts we are enabled to detedl \\nanother error alfo, into which the fame great man has been \\nbetrayed. In his analyfis of the acidulous waters of Medvl, \\nin Oflro-Gothland (Bergman's Ejfays, Differtation vm. 6.), \\nhe has noticed a refiduum of 4- grains of iron, diflolved \\npartly by hepatic gas, partly by carbonic acid;. Now we \\nhave feen that there is no decompofltion of thefe liqiaors by \\nboiling; nor does any oxyde precipitate, how long foever \\nthe evaporation be continued. The hepatic gas feems to \\nbe totally decompofed : n.itric acid dropped into thefe li¬ \\nquors precipitates nothing. \\nAre we then to conclude with Mr. Kirwan, that hepatic \\ngas does not decompofe iron or any other metal ? As the \\ngas itfelf is decompofed, this, in ftridl propriety of language, \\nmult be allowed to be true ; but that fome folution is \\neffedied during the decompofltion the following remarks \\nevince. 3. A piece of clean and bright iron was put into \\nfome of the hepatifed folution (if I may be allowed fo to \\ncall it, while its true compofition is unknown) : it foon be¬ \\ncame turbid *, a copious ochry precipitate fell down ; and \\nin 24 hours*the whole furface of the iron was covered with \\nruft. 4. Let the folution be boiled in a copper veflel, a \\nprecipitate alio feparates of an ochry colour ; but it is fmall- \\ner in quantity than in the former experiment. 5. Digeft a \\npiece of clean iron in the folution after it has been boiled.in \\na copper veflel ; much ochry matter fliil icparates ; but there \\n•is no veflige of metallic copper on the iron plate. 6.

From all thefe faffs it is clear, that as the iron com¬ \\nbines with the fulphur of the hepatic gas, a- peculiar fubftance \\nis formed and diffolved in the water, which has hitherto been \\nunnoticed by chemical writers, as far as has fallen within my \\ninformation. That this fubftance is contained in the waters \\nof the fpring under our prefect examination, feems fully \\nedtablifhed by the concurrent evidence of fo many pheno¬ \\nmena in which they completely coincide. Compare in, \\n1 & 2. iv. }, 2, 3, 4, & 5. \\nIX. MANGANESE EXPOSED TO HEPATIC GAS. \\nTo complete the demonflration, it is neceftary to examine \\nthe action of hepatic gas upon manganefe. \\nI. I digefled fome black oxyde of manganefe in hepatifed \\nwater: it had been previoufly purified, by being boiled re¬ \\npeatedly in diHilled water *. The hepatic fmell of the gas \\nis quickly impaired* and in 24 hours, if enough of the oxyde \\nhas been ufed, it is perfectly deflroyed * Hill the liquor has a \\npeculiar fmell, which can hardly be called offenfive: no gas \\nis extricated in this prccefs. The liquor, after filtration, was \\n*■ The readied method of purifying this fubftance is to boil it fir ft ill a \\nvery large quantity of rain water; after which, a Tingle boiling in diftilled \\nwater will be fufHcient to extradt every Joluble impurity. \\n4 \\nexamined \\n', 'Origin of the Muriatic Acid. 267 \\nexamined by the fame re-agents as the hepatifed folution of \\niron (vm. 1.) with nearly a fimilar refult; a minute quan¬ \\ntity of fulphuiic acid was detected j pruflfat of potafh gave \\na fmall white cloud ; tinCture of galls a flight yellow tingd. \\nJlepeating the experiment with gas extricated by the muriatic \\nacid, there was, in this cafe, no trace of fulphuric acid, and \\nthe liquor was not at all rendered turbid by pruffiat of pot¬ \\nafh, From both thefe folutions pure potafh feparates a very \\nminute white precipitate. 2. But, in one refpect, thefe fo¬ \\nlutions differed from the folutions of iron; for, by thefe, \\nnitrat of filver is inftantaneoufty decompofed, and a copious \\nprecipitate feparates ; it is of a dark brown or yellow colour, \\nas if from a combination of fulphur. Oxygenated muriat of \\nmercury let fall a white matter, much more plentifully than \\nfrom the folutions of iron. Tartrite of potafh is decompofed, \\nand a fine cryftalline fubftance is feparated, which is the tar¬ \\ntrite of manganefe. \\n3. This folution is affeCted by metals in a manner fimilar \\nto the folution of iron. A piece of clear iron becomes \\nquickly covered with ruff, and an ochry matter feparates. If \\nthe liquor be boiled in a copper veffel, fome matter alfo \\nfeparates of the fame colour, and the furface of the veffel is \\nevidently aCted upon. Thus the analogy between thefe \\njhepatifed folutions and the water of this fpring appears to \\nme completely eftablifhed; and it may be concluded that \\nthis water contains a triple compound, the balls of which is \\nIron and manganefe, and the folution ©f which is effected by \\nhepatic gas. \\nX. ORIGIN OF THE MURIATIC ACID. \\nThe coincidence between the artificial products and the \\nnatural waters of the fpring is fufficiently proved: another \\ncoincidence remains to be conGdered, much more interefting \\nAnd more unexpected—the coincidence between the licpa* \\ntifed folution of iron and the oxygenated muriat of iron. 1 \\nhad almoft concluded, from the’ refemblance between the \\nproperties \\n', '-Origin of the Muriatic Acid, \\nproperties of this ialt and the phenomena of the water, that \\nthe water contains this very fait: now, I conclude, that they \\n.contain a matter, be it what it may, produced by the aclion \\nof hepatic gas on iron. But they are the very fame facts \\nwhich form the bafis upon which each feparate inference \\nis built:—does it not then follow as a neceftary confequence, \\nthat the hepatifed folution itfelf contains a muriat of iron \\nhighly oxygenated, and that, therefore, in this procefs muriatic \\nacid is generated? This conclufion feems authorifed by \\nreafon, and experiment has confirmed it. I. I evaporated a \\nfrnall quantity of the folution (vui. I.) in a watch glafs to \\ndrynefs: a bitter deliquefcent fait is left behind : on this \\nfait a little ftrong fulphuric acid was dropped, and paper \\nmoiftened with ammoniac was held over the glafs ; white \\nvapours were immediately formed over the glafs : feme \\nvolatile acid is, therefore, feparated by the fulphuric acid. \\n2. I evaporated about 8 ounce-meafures of the fame liquor, \\nand, as before, dropped.a little fulphuric acid on the re- \\nfiduum ; in this cafe a throng efferveicence was excited, very \\npungent acid fumes arofe, which, from their finell, were \\nreadily known to be muriatic. She fame truth was efta- \\nblifhed beyond a doubt by holding a bit of paper moiftened \\nwith fimple water, which made the vapours vifible in the \\nform of a grey fmoke—a diftinguifhing charadteriftic of the \\nmuriatic acid. (Bergman’s Effays, Dif estation JL n. b. 3) \\nThe evaporation had been performed in a copper vefiel, ex¬ \\ncept at its clofe ; and though it was carried on very rapidly, \\nthe deliquefcent matter had acquired a ftrong cupreous tafte. \\n3. The hepatifed folution of manganefe (ix. 1.) evaporated \\nto drynefs, leaves a deliquefcent fait Gf a peculiar mawkilh \\ntafte ; and it (hews the fame figns of muriatic acid as the \\nfolution of iron, when treated with fulphuric acid in the \\nfame way. I have expofed black oxyde of manganefe t® \\noxygenated muriatic acid, and find that a deliquefcent fait is \\nformed, which is affected neither by pruftiat of potafh nor \\ntincture of galls *,—alkalies feparate from it (what I did not \\nx expert \\n', \"Meafuremeni of the Meridian. \\nlxpe&) white precipitates; tartrite of potafli, a cryftalline \\niftfoluble fait: all properties refembling the hepatifed folu- \\ntion of manganefe. 4. Common iron ruft, purified by boil¬ \\ning in diftilled water, was digefted in hepatifed water. In \\n1 day or two the hepatic odour is deftroyed, and the liquor \\nhas properties fimilar to that which was formed with the \\niron filings. 'I he fame kind of deliquefcent fait is left by \\nevaporation, {hewing the fame appearances of muriatic acid. \\nHowever, this liquor refembles the folution of manganefe in \\nprecipitating nitrat of filver readily, and of a brown colour \\n(ix. 2.). 5. I treated mercury in the fame way : no gas \\nefcapes in this experiment, as it does with the iron 5 a black \\niubftance is formed , but the hepatic odour was not deftroyed, \\nthough the hepatic gas was kept in contact with the mercury \\nmany weeks. After filtrating the liquor, I boiled it to expel \\nthe fuperfluous hepatic gas. A fmall portion of the liquor \\nwas fufFered to evaporate fpontaneoully : a cryftalline matter \\nwas left behind of an acrid tafte. Another portion was \\nevaporated, with intention to colledt: more of thofe cryftals 5 \\nbut, by accident, it was left expofed to heat too long, by \\nwhich it became perfedlly dry, and the refiduum became \\nquite black. A little fulphuric acid was dropped on this \\nblack matter, by which it effbrveiced ftrongly, and very \\npungent fumes arofe which had all the properties of muri¬ \\natic acid. \\n[To he concluded in the next Number. ] \\nVII. Method employed between Ad dun and Lieufaint in France,■ \\nto meafure the Bafe of a Triangle, in order to determine \\nthe Length of an Arc of the Meridian. From the Journal \\nde Phyfique, 1798. \\nX HE high road between Lieufaint and Melun has lately \\nbeen the theatre of an operation extremely mterefting, which \\n%viU form 311 epoch in the hiftory of the fciences, In ordei^ \\nto \\n\", '270 Method employed in France \\nto fix invariably the ftandard of the metre *, two celebrated \\naftronbmers, Delambre and Mechain, were commiffioned to \\nmeafure an acre of the meridian, by a feries of triangles \\ncarried from Dunkirk to Barcelona f. To calculate the Tides \\nof thefe triangles, it was necefiary to fet out from a primitive \\nbafe. None of thofe meafured for the meridian of 1740 \\nhad been determined with fufiicient accuracy, and fome \\nerrors were fufpeaed. As the bafe neareft to Paris, between \\nVillejuif and Juvify, prefented a length of little more than \\n5000 toifes J, with confiderable inequalities of the ground 5 \\nthe road from Lieufaint to Meliin, which gave a length by \\neftimation of 6076 toifes, in almoft a firaight line and with \\nvery little variation in the level, was with great reafon pre* \\nferred. To prepare for the meafurement of this bafe, the \\ntwo fignals or obfervatories, now to be feen, the one at the \\nend of Lieufaint, and the other at the entrance of Melun, \\nwere fil\\'d ere&ed. Within each of thefe fignals a large \\ndone was fecured in a piece of ftrong mafon-work, and from \\nthis done arofe a cylinder of copper, fattened into it with a \\nmafs of lead. The axes of thefe cylinders, which were \\nrouitecn lines in diameter, correfponded perpendicularly \\nwith the upper points of the fignals. As the line of the bafe \\nformed towards the middle a fmall bending, the angle was \\nmeafured, and found to be 379° 1 F, which produced in the \\ntotal length a difference 01 10— inches.

Edit. \\nf It was piopofsfld to extend this labour to Majorca; but it was found \\nimpoffible to proceed to that Nation, on account of the too great difiance \\nof the fignals. \" * . f »> I \\n£ The object of Delambre and Mechain’s labour being to cftablilL a \\nrelation between tne old and the new meafures, and this labour having \\nbeen begun in 1791, it was necefiary that the meafurem’ent fhouid he ex- \\npiefled in tciies, and ftailions of a toife; the ufe of which could not be \\nabandoned till the metre was exa&ly determined. The commiffion of \\nweights aiiQ meafures gave, according to the ancient mode of calculation, \\na provifionai metre, the approximation of which is more than fulicient for \\n\\'.nmmon vfes. This metre furpaffes the half tcil\\'e by II.44 lines. \\nfummifc \\n', \"to tneafare an Arc of the Meridian. 271 \\nfummit of this angle, poles in the direction of each of the \\nfignals wete eredfed, at the diftance of every hundred toifes* \\nAt the bottom of each of thefe poles, a wooden wedge was \\ndriven into the ground to fuch a depth that nothing could \\nalter its portion, and the place of each of the wedges was \\nmarked by heaps of hones difpofed along the road. \\nAfter thefe preliminary labours, Delambre began the ope¬ \\nration of meafurement on the 5 th of Floreal, at the bafe of \\nthe fignal of Melun. The inftruments conftrucfed for this \\npurpofe were four rules of platina, each two fathoms in \\nlength (at a given temperature) ; fix lines in breadth, and \\ntwo thirds of a line in thicknefs. Each rule was mounted \\non a piece of wood, fufficiently ffrong to be fecure aga’infl \\nall warping and bending *, and was covered, at the diftance \\nOf three inches, with a flight cafe of wood, at the two \\nextremities of which arofe two points made of iron, to ferve \\nas marks to diredt thb fight. On the rule of platina there \\nwas placed another rule of copper of the fame ftrength, but \\nfomewhat lefs in length, which ferved to'meafure the ex- \\npanfion of the platina. It is well known by experience, that \\nthe expanfion of platina is to that of copper as .12 is to 25* \\nThe two rules were fixed upon each Other, in an invariable \\nmanner by their anterior extremity, in order that the efFedf \\nof the expanfion might be carried entirely to the other ex¬ \\ntremity. The rules being plunged into melting ice, and \\nconfequently at o° of Reaumur’s thermometer (320 Fahr.), \\nthe extremity of the copper coincided on the platina at a line \\nmarked ; but as foon as they were expofed to another tem¬ \\nperature, the copper extended on the platina, on account of \\nthe different expanfion of the two metals. An ingenious \\napparatus conftrucfed on this principle, afforded,, with the \\naffiflance of a nonius and rnicrOfcope fitted to it, the means \\nof eftimating the dilatation of the platina to nearly 3000^ \\nof a toife. This apparatus formed at the fame time a very \\nfenfible metallic thermometer, each part or degree of which \\ncorrefponded to a dilatation of 0^00009245 of a toife, on \\neach- \\n\", \"ijx Method employed in Trance - \\n<£ach rule of the platina *. The four rules were placed it \\nthe end of each other, fupported by iron tripods mounted on \\nthree fcrews, to make the extremities correfpond at equat \\nheights, and brought1 into a' line by marks to diredh the fight, \\nplaced fuccedively on the wooden wedges before mentioned* \\nHad each ride been placed in immediate contact with its neigh¬ \\nbour, the operator in placing one rule might have deranged \\nthe preceding, and the contact befides would never have \\nbeen perfeft. To prevent this inconvenience, care was taken’ \\nto leave a fufftcient interval from One rule to another; but \\nthe extremity of each rule was furnifhed with a fmall fule, \\nor flip of platina, which could be pufbed into a groove to fill¬ \\nup‘the interval, and to form a perfect contact wi.h the fol¬ \\nlowing rule: a fcale fitted with a nonius, viewed through a' \\nmrcrofcope, meafured the length of the fmall rule, to nearW \\n„ f.-dt-Qis of a toife. But in thus meafuring a line on ground, \\nWhich often rifes Of falls inferifibl'y, it was neceffary to pay \\ngreat attention to the differences of the level. ~ For this pur- \\npofe the cafe of each rule had, at equal diftances from itsT \\nextremities-, two fmall cubes made of copper, which rofe to \\nequal heights on the plane of the rules ;; and upon which \\nWere laid the two branches of a fquare, bearing a fpirit level. \\nThis level being twice placed'on each rale, in the-two-con-' \\nt*aryq dire£lio,ns, gave the mean inclination almoft to a1 \\n♦ \\nminute y fo that with a very fimple formula each rneafure \\nwas found reduced to the horizontal line, and the feries of \\nobfervations gave at the fame time the complete level of the* \\nbafe. In commencing the operation, the fir ft rule was \\nplaced in fuch a manner that the centre of a plummet, fuf- \\npended at its- anterior extremity, fhouid- fail exactly on the \\ncentre of the copper cylinder, already mentioned, which \\n* Allufion is made here not to common thermometers, but to newly \\ninvented metallic thermometers,.divided according to a new decimal fcale, \\nof which 2.316 parrs correfpond to one degree of Reaumur. To exprefs$ \\ntherefore, that degree of expanfron of the platina, 0.000009245 muft bsr \\nmultiplied by 2,^16, which gives a little more than 0.00002. \\nforme# \\n\", 'to meafure an Arc of the Meridian. 2*3 \\nformed a point of departure under the fignal of Melun, The \\nrules 2, 3 and 4 were placed in a feries after the fir ft, and \\nbrought into a line with the fight. The fmall rules, or flips, \\nwere pufned in to fill up the intervals 5 and the lengths o£ \\nthefe flips, as well as the expanfion of each rule, and the \\nobfervations of the level, read by Qelambre, were written, as \\nhe dictated, by two afliftants, who each held a paper divided \\ninto columns for that purpofe. After this the firft rule was \\nremoved and placed after the fourth rule, and the fame ope¬ \\nration was repeated, directing the line always by the fight- \\npoints, removed fucceffively at the diflance of every hundred \\ntoifes, and taking care at each change of the rule to read the \\nexpanfion, the length of the flip, and the two obfervations of \\nthe level. \\nThis operation being repeated 3021 times, rendered it \\nconfequently neceffary to make 6042 obfervations by the mi* \\ncrofcope, and as many of the level. This was continued \\nwithout interruption during the day ; and when night obliged \\nthe operators to fufpend their labour, the following method \\nwas employed to fix the point where they left off, and which \\nwas to ierve next morning for the point of departure. To¬ \\nwards the extremity of the lafl rule an iron (take was funk \\ninto the ground, and a pretty deep hole dug around it. The \\niron flake was then removed, and its place fupplied by a \\nwooden flake, on the furface of which was nailed a plate of \\nleaa. U lie laid rule was placed in fuch a manner that a \\nplummet, nicely adjufted and fufpended from its extremity, \\nihould fall on this plate ; the point where it touched the lead \\nwas marked as exaclly as poflible, and the wooden flake \\nwas defended by a flrong povering of wood, which was itfelf \\ncovered with earth, fo that carriages could pafs over it with¬ \\nout caufing any derangement. Things remained in this flate \\ntill next morning, when the operations were refumed in the \\nlike manner as that of the firfl day.

A month’s la¬ \\nbour would fcarcely be fufficient to terminate all the opera¬ \\ntions which have been judged jndifpenfibly neceflary for ob¬ \\ntaining that beautiful colour called the Turkey or Adri- \\nanople red. Soda, oil, gall nuts, fumach, the fulphate of \\nalumine, blood, the gaftric liquor, madder, foap, the nitro- \\nmuriate of tin, are employed in fucceffion. The true means \\nof Amplifying this procefs is not to labour at hazard, and to \\nmake trial of the different methods pra&ifed without a \\n* 5 guide \\n', 'in dyeing Cotton red. 275 \\n•guiclc and without principles.

I am ac¬ \\nquainted but with one method of making progrefs in the \\narts, which is, to bring back and reduce all operations to \\nAmple principles : by thefe means we obtain fixed points of \\ndeparture, to which all refults and all our labours may be \\nreferred. Chemiftry is now fufficiently advanced to fupply \\nus with thefe bafes, and nothing therefore is neceflary but to \\neftablifh them. In the hands of the artifl they will become \\nwhat formulae are in the head of the mathematician. I \\nfhall therefore attempt to give an example by fubjecling to \\nchemical principles the three chief mordants in dyeing cot¬ \\nton red ; viz. oil, gall nuts, and alum. \\n-It is known that cotton-does not receive -the red of mad¬ \\nder in a fixed manner until it has been properly impregnated \\nwith oil. The red applied by printing is far from poflefling \\nthe fame degree of fixity, fince it will not Hand when wafhed \\nwith foda. This preliminary preparation is given to cotton \\nby forming a cold foapy liquor from the combination of oil \\nand a weak folution of foda. The ufe of this alkaline ley is \\nattended with no other advantage than that of diluting and \\ndividing the oil, aiid enabling the operator to convey it to \\nall the parts of the cotton in an equal and eafy manner. I \\nhave found by experience that potafh produces the fame ef« \\nte£t as foda and, in my opinion, this faff merits fome con- \\nfideration, as foda, which is fcarce and dear in the north, \\nmay be lupplied by potafh, which is there common. \\nFrom this principle it follows, that all kinds of foda or oil \\ncannot be employed indiferiminately. I11 order that the foda \\nmay have the proper qualities, it mu ft be cauftic, and con¬ \\ntain little muriate. It muft not be rendered cauftic by lime, \\nas it then makes the colour brown. Its caufticity muff be \\nthe effect of its calcination. \\nThe carbonate of foda, and foda mixed with much mu- \\n* \\ntiate, combine with oil but very imperfectly. Therefore \\nT 2 foda \\n', '0# the Effect of Mordants \\nfoda that has been long prepared, or is impure, cannot be \\napplied to the purpofes of dyeing in this manner. \\nThe choice of the oil is equally effential as that of the foda. \\nThe oil, to be good, mu ft unite very perfectly with the ley \\nof foda, and muft remain in an abfolute and permanent (late \\nof combination. I he oil fitted; for this dye is not fine oil, \\nbut that rather which contains a large portion of the extrac¬ \\ntive principle. The former does not preferve its (late of \\ncombination with the foda, and requires fuch a flrength in \\nthe ley as would be injurious to the fubfequent operations. \\nThe latter forms a thicker and more durable combination, \\nand requires only a weak ley of one or two degrees. \\nThe neceffity of producing a perfedl and intimate combi¬ \\nnation of the oil and the foda will be readily perceived, by \\nreflecting that the ley of foda is only employed to divide, \\ndilute, and convey the oil in an equal manner to all the \\nparts of the cotton : for it follows from this principle, that; \\nif the oil is not well mixed, the cotton made to pafs through \\nthis mordant will take the oil unequally, and the colour, \\ntherefore, will be badly united. Hence it happens that \\nthe workman places the whole fecret of a well-united and \\nflrong colour in the choice of good oil and fustable foda. \\nIt thence follows from thefe principles that the oil ought \\nto be in excefs, and not in a (late of abfolute faturation } for \\nin the latter cafe it would abandon the fluff in waffling, and \\nthe colour would remain dry. \\nWhen the cotton has been properly impregnated with \\npil, it is fubjedled to the operation of being galled. The \\nufing of the gall nuts is attended with feveral advantages : \\ni. The acid which they contain decompofes the faponaceous \\nliquor with which the cotton is impregnated, land fixes the \\noil on the fluff. 2- The character of animalifation which \\nthe galls have, predifpofes the cotton to receive the colour¬ \\ning matter. 3. The aftringent principle unites with the oil, \\nand forms with it a compound which blackens as it dries * \\nwhich \\n4 \\n', 'Mi dyeing Cotton red. 277, \\nV7hich is not very foluble in water,and which has the greateft; \\naffinity with the colouring principle of the madder. The \\ndyer may acquire a competent knowledge of this laft com¬ \\nbination, and ftudy its properties, by mixing a deco&ion of \\ngall nuts with a folution of foap. \\nIt follows from thefe principles : 1. That the place of the \\ngall nuts cannot be fupplied by any other aftringent, let the \\nquantity employed be what it may. 2. That the galls ought \\nto be (trained as hot as poffible, that the decompolition may \\nbe fpeedy and perfedt. 3. That the galled cotton ought to \\nbe fpeedily dried, in order to prevent its affuming a black \\ncolour, which Would injure the brightnefs of the red intend¬ \\ned to be given to it. 4. That dry weather ought to be \\nchofen for the procefs of galling, becaufe in moift weather \\nthe aftringent principle communicates a black colour, and dries \\n(lowly. 5. The cotton ought to be prefied together with the \\ngreateft care, in order that the decompolition may be ef- \\nfedled in an equal manner at every point of the furface. \\n6. That a proportion ought to be eftablifhed between the \\ngall nuts and the foap : if the former predominates, the co¬ \\nlour is black ; if the latter, the portion of the oil not com¬ \\nbined with the aftringent principle then efcapes by the waffi- \\nings, and the colour remains poor. \\nThe third mordant employed in dyeing cotton red is the \\nfulphate of alurriine (alum). This fubftance not only has \\nof itfelf the property of heightening the red of madder, but it \\ncontributes alfo by its decompofition and the fixation of its \\nalumine to give folidity to the colour. To judge of the ef- \\nfe£ls of alum in dyeing cotton, it will be fufficient to mix a \\ndecodlion of gall ntits with a folution of alurm The mixture \\nbecomes immediately turbid, and there is formed a greyiffi pre¬ \\ncipitate, which^when dried, Is infoltible in water and alkalies* \\nEvery thing that takes place in this experiment of the la¬ \\nboratory may be obferved in the procefs of aluming in dye¬ \\ning. Cotton, when galled and plunged in a folution of the \\nfvtUate or acetite of alumine, immediately changes its colour, \\nT J and \\n', \"On the EffeB of Mordants, Ofc. \\nand becomes grey *, the bath prefents na precipitate, becaufe \\nthe operation takes place in the tiffue of the cloth itfelf, \\nwhere the production remains fixed. It is however to be \\nobferved, that if the galled cotton be palled through a too \\nwarm folution of alum, a portion of the galls efcapes ffonv \\nthe tiffue of the fluff, and the decompofition of the alum \\ntakes place in the bath itfelf ; which diminifhes the propor¬ \\ntion of the mordant, and impoverifhes the colour. \\nWe have-'here therefore a combination of three principles \\n(oil, the aflringent principle, and alumine) -which ferve as a \\nmordant for the red dye of madder. Each of them employed \\nfeparately produces neither the fame fixation nor. the fame \\nlullre in the colour. \\nThis mordant,without difpute, is1 the mod complex known4 \\nin dyeing, and it prefents to chemibry a fort of combination \\nwhich it is of the ufmoft importance to fludy. It is from' \\nthe precifion in this combination, and the judgement fhewn \\nby the artift himfelf to produce It, that a beautiful colour \\ncan be expected * but if it be poffible for liim to conduct \\nhimfelf through the labyrinth of thefe numerous operations, \\nby taking the clue of experiment as his guide, it will at any \\nrate be very difficult for him to fimplify his progrefs, or bring \\nIt to perfection. It is only byreafoning on his operations, and \\ncalculating the redid and principle of each, that he can hope \\nto become mafker of his procefies, to correct their faults, \\nand to obtain invariable produces. Without this, the \\npractice of the mod experienced artid will afford nothing in \\nhis hands but the difeoimaging alternative of fuccefs and dis¬ \\nappointment. I wifhed therefore in this fhort analyfis of \\nthe procefs-for dyeing red, which is the mod complicated \\nof all, to give an indance of what chemidry can do in the \\narts when its principles are properly applied. T will venture \\nto affert, that the mob uninformed workman will here find \\nthe principle of hisart and the rule of his conduct. \\nIX.

A hundred parts of this mineral reduced to a fine \\npowder, were mixed with 300 parts of the faturated carbo¬ \\nnate of potafli, and about 4000 parts of watery and this \\nmixture was expofed for an hour to a boiling heat. I ob» \\nferved, ill, that when thefe matters began to a£t upon each \\nother there was produced a ftrongeffervefcence which con¬ \\ntinued a long time ; 2d, that the orange colour of the lead \\nbecame a brick red ; 3d, that at a certain period the whole \\nmatter feemed todiffolve; 4th, that in proportion as the ef- \\nfervefcence advanced the matter re-appeared under the form \\nof a granulated powder, of a dirty yellow colour; 5th, that \\nthe liquor affirmed a beautiful golden yellow colour. \"When \\nthe eftervefcence had entirely fubfided, and appeared to \\nhave no longer any a£Hon on the fubftances, the liquor \\nwas filtered, and the metallic dull collected on the paper. \\nAfter being wafhed and dried, it weighed no more than \\n78 parts : the potafli therefore had taken from it 22 parts. \\nExp. II. I poured upon the 78 parts juft mentioned, fome \\nof the nitric acid, diluted in twelve parts of water, which \\nproduced a brilk effervefcence. The greater part of the \\nmatter was diffolved : the liquor affumed no colour; and\\' \\nthere remained Only a fmall quantity of powder of an orange- \\nyellow colour. I feparated the liquor of the refiduum by \\nthe help of a fyphon, wafhed the matter feveral times, and \\nunited the walkings with the firft liquor.

The two nitric {elutions united and evaporated,* \\nproduced 92 parts of nitrate of lead, cryftallifed in o&aedra, \\nperfectly white and tranfparent. Thefe 92 parts of nitrate \\nof lead, diffolved in water, were precipitated by a folution of \\nthe fulfate of foda. This produced 81 parts of the fulfate \\nof lead, which were equivalent to 5^68 of metallic lead. \\nExp. V. The alcaline liquors united, had an orange-yel¬ \\nlow colour. They depofited at the end of fome days two \\nparts of a yellow powder which contained no more lead. \\nThefe liquors, fubje£led to evaporation until a faline pellicle: \\nwas formed on their furface, produced, on cooling, yellow \\ncrydals 5* among which there was carbonate of potalh, not \\ndecompofed. Thefe cryftals diffolved in water, and the \\nfolution united with the mother water, the whole was \\nmixed with weak nitric acid until the carbonate of potafh \\nwas faturated. The liquor then had a very dark orange- \\nred colour. Being united with a folution of the muriate of \\ntin, newly made, it fird affumed a brown colour, which af¬ \\nterwards became greenidi. Mixed with a folution of the \\nnitrate of lead, it immediately produced the red lead. Lad- \\nly, evaporated fpontaneoufly, it produced ruby-red cryftals, \\nmixed with cryftals of the nitrate of potafh. Ninety-eight \\nparts of this mineral, decompofed as above mentioned, hay¬ \\ning produced 81 parts of the fulfate of lead, 100 parts \\nwould have given 82.65, which are equivalent to 57.1 ,of \\nmetallic lead. But admitting, as experiment proves, that \\n100 parts of lead abforb, in combining with acids, 12 parts \\nof oxygene, the 57.1 of metallic lead ought to contain in \\nthe red lead 6.86 of this principle, and we ought to have \\nfor the mineralifing acid 36.4. \\nExp. VI. To verify by fynthelis the {proportions of the \\nprinciples of the red lead found by analyfis, I diffolved 50 \\ngrains or about 2.654 grammes of metallic lead in the nitric \\nacid ; and the folution having been divided into two equal \\nparts, the one was completely precipitated by the neceffary \\nquantity \\n', \"On the new Mcial called Chrome \\nquantity of tire combination of the acid of red lead with pot-* \\na(h, and I obtained 43 grains, or about 2.282 grammes of \\nred lead, as beautiful as the natural mineral.

Thus, by this \\nfynthefis, 100 parts of red lead would be compofed of 65.12 \\nof the oxyde of lead and 34.88 of acid. By analyfis, as \\nhas been fhewn, it gives only 1.72* lefs in the acid which \\nmineralifes the red lead—a difference which approaches as \\nnear to corre&nefs as chemical means will admitf. \\nThough the properties above fhewn were- more than fuffi- \\neient, ftriClly fpeaking, to convince any one well acquainted \\nwith the differential characters of metallic fubftances, that \\nthe one in quefti'oh belongs to a particular Ipecies, I thought \\nit my duty to compare its acid by a feries of combinations \\nwith the mol'ybdie acid, in fome properties of which if \\nfeems to partake. \\nComparative Experiments on the JlLoIybdic Acid and that of \\nRed Lead.

As I do not recoiled! to have feen this animal \\neither figured or defcribed by any author in natural hiftory, \\nI flatter my fie If, thefie obfervations may afford fomc {Satisfac¬ \\ntion to the prefident and members of the Linnean Society. \\nThe fpecimens from which I made the drawing are now in \\nmy collection.

The fi-rll I was \\ni’o fortunate to catch was taken in a large field near the falls \\nof Montm'orenci, and by its having ftrayed too far from the \\nfkirts of the wood, allowed myfelf, with the afliftance of \\nthree other gentlemen, to furround it, and after an hour’s \\nhard chafe to get it unhurt, though not before it was \\nthoroughly fatigued ; which might in a great meafure ac¬ \\ncelerate its death. \\nDuring the time the animal remained in its ufual vigour, \\nits agility was incredible for fo fmall a creature. It always \\ntook progreflive leaps of from three to four, and fometimes \\nof five yards, although feldom above 12 or 14 inches from the \\nfurface of the grafs; but I have frequently obferved others \\nin fhrubby places and in the woods, amongfi: plants, where \\nthey chiefly refide, leap considerably higher. When found \\nin fuch places, it is impofiible to take them, from their won- \\n. derful agility, and their evading all purfuit by bounding into \\nthe thickeft cover they can find. \\nWith refpedf to the figure given of it in its dormant date, \\nI have to obferve, that fpecimen was found by fome work¬ \\nmen, in digging the foundation for a fnmmer-houfe, in a \\ngentleman's garden about two miles from Quebec, in the \\nlatter end of May 1787. \\nIt was difcovered enclofed in a ball of clay, about the fize \\nof a cricket-hall, nearly an inch in thicknefs, perfectly fmooth \\nwithin, and about 20 inches under ground. The man who \\nfirft difcovered it, not knowing what it was, flruck the ball \\nwith his fpade, by which means it was broken to pieces, or \\nthe ball alfo would have been prefented to me. The draw¬ \\ning will perfectly (hew how the animal is laid during its \\ndormant ftate. \\nHow long it had been under ground it is impofiible to \\nfay; but as I never could obferve thefe animals in any parts \\nof the country after the beginning of September, I conceive \\nthey lay themfelvcs up fome time in that month, or beginning \\nof \\n\", '’Theory of Cryfa Ufa tr-ofu \\nof Oolober, when the frofl becomes (harp : nor did I ever \\nfee them again before the lad week in May, or beginning of \\nJune.

But the power which eftedls the fubtrac- \\ntions feems to have a very limited a£lion. Thefe fubtrac- \\ntions for the moft part take place by one or two ranges of \\nmoleculse. I have found none which exceeded four ranges, \\nexcept in a variety of calcareous fpar, forming part of the \\ncolledlion of C. Gillet Laumont, the ftru£ture of which I \\nhave lately determined, and which depends on a decrement \\nby fix ranges ; fo that, if there exift laws which exceed the \\nde rements by four ranges, there is reafon’ to believe that \\nthey rarely take place in nature. Yet, notwithftanding thefe \\nnarrow limits, by which the laws of cryftallifation are cir- \\ncumferibed, I have found, by confining myfelf to two of the \\nfimpleft laws, that is to fay, thofe which produce fubtra£tions \\nby one or two ranges, that calcareous fpar is fufceptible \\nU 2 * of \\n', '*Theory of CryftaUifation. \\nof two thoufand and forty-four different forms : a numbei* \\nwhich exceeds more than fifty times that of the forms al¬ \\nready known*, and if we admit into the combination de¬ \\ncrements by three and four ranges, calculation will give \\n8,388,604 poflible forms in regard to the fame fubftance. \\nThis number may be fliil very much augmented in confe- \\nquence of decrements either mixed or intermediary. \\nThe ftriae remarked on the furface of a multitude of cryf- \\ntals afford a new proof in favour of theory, as they always \\nhave directions parallel to the projecting edges of the laminae \\nof fuperpofition, which mutually go beyond each other, un- \\nlefs they arife from fome particular want of regularity.

Girtan- \\nner afcribes it chiefly to oxygen : but the proofs which he \\ngives in fuppoft of his opinion do not appear fatisfa&ory \\\\ \\n(ince the air does not feem to have a direct influence on \\nthe irritability of the heart. For example, if the vein of an \\nanimal be opened, and if a bubble of vital air or oxygen gas \\ncan be introduced into it, by means of a fmall tube, as foori \\nas the air reaches the heart the animal fends forth a cry of \\npain and expires. Bichet, who made this experiment *, re¬ \\npeated it with atmofpheric air, azot, hydrogen, and the car¬ \\nbonic acid gas, and the animal peri (lied in the like manner ; \\nbut cold water injected into a vein does not produce the \\nlike effect.

It has \\nthence been afferted, that oxygen has the fame efFedl upon \\nthofe plants called fenfitive, fuch as the humble plant {mi- \\nmofa pudica), the hedyfarum gyrans, &c. as upon animals. \\nPefchier has made feveral experiments to-afcertain whe¬ \\nther this opinion was well founded; but oxygen never ap¬ \\npeared to him to produce any efFedt upon thefe plants. He \\nafterwards examined whether thefe movements of thofe \\nplants called fenfitive are owing to real irritability, like that \\nof animals. The numerous experiments which he made \\non this fubjedl gave him reafon to conclude, that no real \\nirritability could be afcribed to thefe plants, and that all the \\nmovements they experience, by the fimple touch or other- \\nwife, are merely mechanical; and indeed plants have nei¬ \\nther^ nerves nor mufcles, nor any organs analogous to thofe \\nwhich, in animals, appear to be the feat of irritability. \\nThis difference in the organization of animals and vege¬ \\ntables cannot be denied ; but on the other hand it is equally \\ncertain, that what is called irritability in animals is owing to \\nmechanical caufes. The movement of the mufcular fibre in \\nanimals is altogether as mechanical as the fhrinking of a \\nfprig of the fenfitive plant when it is touched. That of the \\nmufcular fibre is owing to ah efflux of the nervous fluid ; \\nthat of the fenfitive to the efflux of another fluid, which is as \\nlittle known. * But it may here perhaps be faid, The animal \\nfibre, fuch as the heart, is flill irritable a long time after it \\nhas been feparated from the reft of the body, which is not \\nthe cafe with the vegetable fibre. This is true : but it does \\nnot prove that it is not always a mechanical caufe which \\nauts in thefe circumftances ; its adlion only is of longer \\nduration ; \\n', 'On Germination. 309 \\nduration ; for, in whatever manner the action of this muf- \\ncular fibre be confidered, it cannot be moved but by phyfical \\ncaufes. The quefiion then will be, to difcover wkat are \\nthefe phyfical caufes. \\nIt appears very certain that the caufe of mufcular move¬ \\nment is owing to the nerves^ fince a part in which the \\nnerves are palfied, or confined by a ligature, has no longer \\nany movement. But how does the nerve move ? Some \\nphilofophers have compared its movement to the ofcillations \\nof an extended cord which is {truck: But, 1. The nerves \\nare not extended: 2.

I have fup- \\npofed that this nervous fluid is of a nature analogous to \\nthat of the aura feminalis.

On the Effects of Oxygen in accelerating Germination. \\nFrom the Journal de Phyfique, 1798. \\n-S/f-R. Humboldt difeovered, in 1793, that fimple metallic \\nfubftances are unfavourable to the germination of plants, \\nand that metallic oxydes favour it in proportion to their \\ndegree of oxydation. This difeovery induced him to fearch \\nfor a fubftance with which oxygen might be fo weakly com¬ \\nbined as to be eafily feparated, and he made choice of oxy¬ \\ngenated muriatic acid gas mixed with water. Creffes (lepi- \\ndium fativum) in the oxygenated muriatic acid fhewed germs \\nat the end of fix hours, and in common water at the end \\nX 3 Of \\n', 'jSO On the EffeEls of Oxygen \\nof 32 hours. The action of the firft fluid on the vegetable \\nfibres is announced by an enormous quantity of air bubble* \\nwhich cover the feeds, a phenomenon not exhibited by \\nwater till at the end of from 30 to 45 minutes. Thefe \\nexperiments announced in Humboldt’s Flora Subterranea \\nFribergenfs, and in his Aphorifms on the chemical phyfiology \\nof Plants, have been repeated by others *. They were made \\nat a temperature of from 12 to 15 Reaumur. In the fum- \\nmer of 1796, Humboldt began a new feries of experiments, \\nand found that by joining the ftimulus of caloric to that of \\noxygen he was enabled {till more to accelerate the progrefs \\nof vegetation. He took the feeds of garden crefies (lepidiurn \\nfativum), peas [pifum fativuin), french beans (phafeolus vul¬ \\ngaris), garden lettuce (lactuca fativa)y mignonette (refeda \\nodorata) *, equal quantities of which were thrown into pure \\nwater and the oxygenated muriatic acid af a temperature of \\n88° F. Crefles exhibited germs in three hours in the oxygen¬ \\nated muriatic acid, while none were feen in water till the \\n* \\nend of 26 hours. In the muriatic, nitric f or fulphuric \\nacid, pure or mixed with water, there was no germ at all : \\nthe oxygen feemed there to be too intimately united with \\nbafes of azot or fulphur, to be difengaged by the affinities \\nprefented by the fibres of the vegetable. T he author an¬ \\nnounces that his difcoveries, may one day be of great benefit \\nin the cultivation of plants. His experiments have been \\n^repeated with great induflry and zeal by feveral diftinguiflied \\n* See Uflar’s Fragments of Phythology, Plenck’s Phyfiology, Villde- \\nXiow’s Dendrology, and Difiionnaire de Phyjique par Genler. \\nf The nitric acid, however, diluted with a great deal of water, accele¬ \\nrates germination alfo, according to the experiments of Candolle, a young \\nnaturalift, who has applied with gregt fuccefs to vegetable phyfiology. \\nThis phenomenon is the more interefting, as chemiftry affords other ana¬ \\nlogies of the oxygenated muriatic acid and the nitric acid. Profeflbp \\nPfafs, at Kiel, by purfuing Humboldt’s experiments, has found that frogs \\nfuffocated in oxygenated muriatic acid gas increafe in irritability, while thofe \\nwhich perilh in carbonic acid gas are lefs fenfible of Galvanifm. \\n', 'in accelerating Germination. 311 \\njphiiofophers. Profeffbr Pohl at Drefden daufed to germinate \\nIn oxygenated muriatic acid the feed of a new kind of eu~ \\nphorbia taken from Bocconi’s collection of dried plants, \\nno or 120 years old. Jacquin and Vander Schott at \\nVienna threw into oxygenated muriatic acid all the old \\nfeeds which had been kept 20 or 30 years at the botanical \\ngarden, every attempt to produce vegetation in which had \\nbeen fruitlefs, and the greater part of them were ftimulated \\nwith fuccefs. Even the hardeft feeds yielded to this agent. \\nAmong thofe which germinated were the yellow bonduc or \\nnickar tree (guilandina bonduc), the pigeon cytifus or pigeon \\npea (cytifus cajan), the dodoneea angujllfolia^ the climbing mi- \\nmofa (mimofa fcandem)y and new kinds of the homxa.-— \\nThere are now fhewn at Vienna very valuable plants which \\nare entirely owing to the oxygenated muriatic acid, and \\nwhich are at prefent from five to eight inches in height* \\nHumboldt caufed to germinate the clufta rofea% the feeds of \\nwhich had been brought from the Bahama iflands by Boofe, \\nand which before had refilled every effort to make them \\nvegetate. For this purpofe he employed a new procefsj \\nwhich feems likely to be much eafier for gardeners who \\nhave not an opportunity of procuring the oxygenated mu¬ \\nriatic acid : He formed a palte by mixing the feeds with the \\nblack oxyde of manganefe, and then poured over it the mu¬ \\nriatic acid diluted with water. Three cubic inches of water \\nwere mixed with half a cubic inch of the muriatic acid. 1 he \\nveffel which contains this mixture mull be covered, but not \\n.elofely fhut; elfe it might readily burll. At the tempera¬ \\nture of 950 the muriatic acid becomes llrongly oxydated; \\nthe oxygenated muriatic gas which is difengaged paffes \\nthrough the feeds; and it is during this paffage that irritation \\n#f the vegetable fibres takes place. \\nX4 \\nXVI.

On the Invention of the Telegraph, with a Defcription of \\nthat propofed by Dr. HOOKE. \\nrp \\n-=*- HE idea of conveying intelligence,by means of fignals, \\nboth during the day and in the night-time, is of very great \\nantiquity, as appears by the teftimony of feveral ancient \\nauthors *, and there is reafon to believe that fome fort of tele¬ \\ngraph was in ufe even among the Greeks. The deflrudfion of \\nTroy was certainly known in Greece very foon after it took \\nplace, and before any perfon had returned from it. A Greek \\nplay begins with a fcene, in which a Watchman defcends \\nfrom the top of a tower in Greece, and gives information \\nthat Troy is taken : “ I have been looking out thefe ten \\nyears/’ fays he, “ to fee when that would happen, and this \\nnight it has been done.” A night telegraph is alfo exprefsly \\nmentioned by Polybius who in his tenth book gives a very \\ncircumftantial account in what manner the letters of the \\nalphabet may be expreffed by means of torches. \\nIt does not appear, however, that this or any other method \\nof the ancients was ever brought into general ufe, or that \\nany of the moderns had thought of fuch a machine as the \\ntelegraph till the year 1663, when the Marquis of Worcefter \\nin his Century of Inventions affirmed, that “ he had dif- \\ncovered a method by which, at a window, as far as the eye \\ncan difeover black and white, a man might hold difeourfe \\nwith his correfpondent without noife made, or notice taken; \\nbeing according to occafion given or means afforded, ex re \\nnatciy,and no need of provifion before hand, though much \\nbetter if forefeen, and courfe taken by mutual confent of \\nparties.” This could be effected only by a telegraph, which \\nin the next fentence is declared to have been rendered fo \\nperfedf, that by means of it the correfpondence could be \\ncarried on “ by night as well as by day, though as dark as \\npitch is black,” \\n* Lib. x. cap. 40. \\n', 'On the Invention of the Telegraph. \\n3J3 \\nForty years after, M. Amontons, an ingenious French \\nmechanic, born at Paris in 1663, and who died in 1705 at \\nthe age of 42, propofed the following method : <c Let there \\nbe people placed in feveral ftations, at fuch a diftance from \\none another, that by the help of a telefcope a man in one \\nftation may fee a fignal made in the next before him : he \\nmull immediately make the fame fignal, that it may be feen \\nby perfons in the ftation next after him, who are to commu¬ \\nnicate it to thofe in the following ftation, and fo on. Thefe \\nfignals may be as letters of the alphabet, or as a cypher, un- \\n* 1 \\nderftood only by the two perfons who are in the diftant \\nI \\nplaces, and not by thofe who make the fignals. The perfon \\nin the fecond ftation making the fignal to the pejfon in the \\nthird, the very moment he fees it in the firft, the news may \\nbe carded to the greateft diftance in as little time as is ne- \\nceffary to make the fignals in the firft ftation. The diftance \\nof the feveral ftations, which mu ft be as few as poffible, is \\nmeafured by the reach of a telefcope.” Amontons tried this \\nmethod on a fmall trabl of land, before feveral perfons of the \\nhigheft rank at the court of France. \\nWhether the telegraph be a French invention, as that natioq \\nafierts *, or whether Amontons’ plan for conveying intelli¬ \\ngence was founded on the hint thrown out by the Marquis of \\nWorcefter, we fhall not here examine; but it is certain that \\nthe idea of a telegraph, upon a fimilar conftrudlion to thofe \\nufed at prefent, was fuggefted by Dr. Kook towards the end \\n* In Rapport general des fravaux de la Soc’Cte Philcmatique, p. 35, the \\nauthor, fpeaking of the papers read before the fociety, fays : “ Citizen \\nChappe has at different times given you an account of his experiments, \\nand of the refult of thofe labours by which he has been able to bring the \\ntelegraph to its prefent degree of perfection.

Com- \\nmunlcated by the Author. \\nj on mechanics, in treating of the wedge', have \\nfrequently drawn falfe conclufions reipecting the proportion \\nwhich exits between the impelling power applied to the \\nhead, and the refiRing powers oppofed to the fides; and \\nthofe \\n\", 'On the Mechanical Power of the V/edge. 31 y \\nthofe conclufions have refill ted from falfe opinions concern¬ \\ning the directions of the refilling powers. \\nIt is evident, that when wood or other fubftance is fplit by \\na wedge which does not fill the cleft, that is, when the angle \\nof the cleft is more acute than that of the wedge, the power \\nor aCtion of each fide of the wedge, equal and oppofite to the \\nrefifiance of the cleft, mull be refolved into two ; the one in \\nthe direction of the fide of the cleft, which tends to thruft it \\nforward; and the other perpendicular to that direction, \\nwhich tends to tear it afunder. It is by not attending to the \\nabove refolution that writers on this fubjeCt have been led \\ninto miftakes j for, inltead of confidering the powers which \\naCt in thofe two directions, they have imagined a fingle \\npower only as aCting obliquely on each fide. But if the fides \\nof the wedge are perfectly polifiied, as we mult here confider \\nthem, no fingle permanent power can be applied to impel \\nany one of them, unlefs its direction be perpendicular to the \\nplane of the fide to which it is applied : therefore two ob¬ \\nlique powers, applied on oppofite fides of the fame point, are \\nat leaft neceflary to fuftain each other and the aCtion of the \\nplane; and in the cafe of the wedge above mentioned, the \\ndirections of thofe two oblique powers will always be per¬ \\npendicular to each other, as will appear obvious from the \\ntwo following propofitions. \\nProp. I. Let ABC (Pig. 3, Plate X.) be a vertical fec- \\ntion palling through the centre and at right angles to the \\n, head and fides of any ifofceles wedge ; alfo in the plane of \\nthis feCtion, and at right angles to its fides AB, BC, and C A, \\nlet three powers be applied, fuch, that their directions may \\nall mutually imerfeCt in the axis, and their efforts fuftain the \\nwedge in equilibrio ; I fay, that thefe three powers are as \\nAB, BC, and CA refpeCtively. * , r \\nLet LM, KI, ED be the directions of thefe three powers, \\nwhich produced, interfeCt each other and the axis in O. \\nSince, by hypothefis, thefe three powers direCted to the fame \\npoint are in equilibrio, and the three fides of the triangle \\nABC are at right angles to their directions j therefore, by a \\nwell \\n', 'f \\' i \\' Tf\\' * \\ng l $ \\' On the Mechanical Power of the Wedge, \\nTfrell known ftatical principle, the intenfities of thefe powers \\nare as AB, BC, and CA refpe£lively. \\nProp. II. When an impelling power applied to the hedd \\nof an ifofceles wedge is in equilibrio with the refilling powef \\nof a cleft, the angle of which is more acute than that of the \\nwedge inferted, then tmiver folly, \\nThe impelling power applied to the head, \\nThe action of the wedge on either fide of the cleft. \\nThe part thereof which tends to\\'thruft it forward. \\nAnd the remaining part, which tends to tear it afurider. \\nAre \\nAs twice the fine of half the vertical angle of the wedgep \\nThe radius, \\nThe fine of the angle contained by the fides of the wedge \\nand cleft, \\nAnd the confine of that angle rcfpe£tively, the fame \\nradius being common. \\nLet Fig. 2, Plate X. reprefent a vertical fe£tion of the\" \\nwedge and cleft, fimilar in pofition to that deferibed in Pro- \\npofition i ; alfo let the two fides of the cleft DH, DH bet \\nequal, and in contact wfith the fides of the wedge A Gy AC at \\nequal difiances D C, D G from the vertex C, in which cafe \\nthe fides of the wedge make equal angles wfith thofe of the \\nN \\ncleft. Through either point D, draw DF at right angles, \\nand equal to AC; alfo through D, draw DE, at right angles\" \\nto DH, and complete the parallelogram DEFG. Then by \\nPropofition i, the line A A reprefents in quantity the impel¬ \\nling power applied to the head, and the line DF reprefents in \\nquantity and direction the whole adlionof the fide of the wedge \\non that of the cleft, which by hypothefis is balanced by its refill- \\nance; but the power DF is refolved into two, reprefented in \\nquantityand direction by DG, DE refpedlively: the one, being \\nin the direction of the cleft, tends to thrufi it forward; and the \\nother, being at right angles thereto, tends to tear it aftmder. \\nTherefore the powers mentioned in the Propofition are as \\nA A, DF, DG and DE refpe&ively; but AC = DF being \\nradius* thefe lines are refpe&ively equal to \\nTwic« \\n', \"On Qalvanifrit. jig \\nTwice the fine of half the vertical angle of the wedge, \\nThe radius, \\nThe fine of the angle contained by the fides of the wedge \\nand cleft. \\nAnd the co-fine of that angle.

Report of the Commiffioners appointed by the National In- \\nJiitut 'e to repeat the Experiments 'which have been made on Gal- \\nvanifm : read in the Name of the Gommiffion by Git. Halle-. \\nFrom the Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philoma- \\nthique, Thermidor, An-VI. \\nTHE commiftion was not fatisfied with repeating a great \\npart of the experiments already made: they claffed them, \\nand rendered diem complete by the addition of others which \\nwere wanting. \\nI. The phenomenon of Galvanifm, taken in general, is as \\nfollows : A communication is eftablifhed between two points \\nof a feries of nervous or mufcular organs by means of certain \\ndetermined fubftances. At the moment when this commu¬ \\nnication is made, there take place in the (late of the organs \\nchanges, the nature of which is Hill unknown \\\\ but which \\nare manifefted by fenfations more or lefs lively, or contrac¬ \\ntions more or lefs' violent. Thefe mufcular contradtions \\ntake place even in feparated parts of the body, and with as \\nmuch force as when produced by the moft effectual means \\nof irritation. 1 he Xeries of mufcular or nervous organs is \\ncalled the animal arc ; the other fubftances form the exciting \\narc. The compofition of both may be varied many different \\nWays. \\nII. Among the effedls refulting from the different compo- \\nfitions of the animal arc, the following are the moft remarka¬ \\nble : A ligature made on a nerve does not intercept Galvanifm, \\nunlefs it be made in the part furrounded with flefh. If the \\nnerve \\n\", 'I \\n\\\\ - \\n320 On Galvanifm, \\n■ nerve be cut, and its two ends be in contact, Galvanifm \\ntakes place 3 but if they are only brought near to each other, \\nwithout contadt, it is intercepted. \\nIII. Among the efleets refulting from the different compo- \\nfltions of the exciting arc, we {hall remark the following : \\nI he moft favourable compofition is when it confifts of three \\npieces, each of which is a different metal. One mull touch \\nthe nerve, and the other the mufcle : thefe are called the \\nfupports, or armatures. The third forms the communication. \\n> This is called the communicator. Tut one or two of thefe \\nmay be omitted. Animal bodies, or water, may be placed \\nbetween them *, or other fubftances, either metallic combi¬ \\nnations, or all other metals, &c. may be fubflituted in their \\niiead. It has not yet been poffible to determine exadtly \\nwhat are the moft ineffectual combinations ; but they have \\nbeen already claffed to a certain point, according to the de¬ \\ngree of tneir efficacy. Gold, filver, zinc and tin, are the \\nmetals moft iavourable to Galvanifm, ■when introduced into \\nthe exciting arc. \\nIn general a Angle metal does not act, except when all \\notner circumftances are favourable; but in that cafe it has \\nbeen often leen to adt. Error, however, may readily here \\niiiite j fov3 ir one of the ends of the arc be alloyed, in a pro¬ \\nportion ever fo little different, the arc ads as if there were ‘ \\ntwo metals. Ly rubbing one end with a different metal, \\nfometimes even with the fingers, or by breathing upon it, \\nefficacy may be communicated to it, under circumftances \\nwffiere it would not otherwife have poffeffed any. \\nOxydes act lefs efficacioufly, cceteris paribus, than their \\nmetals. Ehy caibon adls as an adtual metal. It is not in¬ \\ntercepted by water and moifl fubftances, nor by the fingers \\nif wet; but this is not the cafe if the fingers be dry. The \\nenergy of Galvanifm is not intercepted or diminifhed by \\npieces of dead flefh. The effedts of it are fenfibly checked \\nby the epideimis 5 and they are incomparably greater in \\ni . flayed \\n', 'On Gahvanifm* t \\nfiayed animals, or in parts of the human body from which \\nthe epidermis has been removed. \\nIt cannot be faid that Galvanifm is intercepted by all idio* \\ndearie bodies *, but, on the other hand, it is intercepted by \\n.all fubftances which are ftrong conductors of elearicitv. \\nSuch are flame, very dry animal bones, the fteam of water, \\nglafs brought to a red heat, &c. \\nIV. Galvanifm is influenced alfo by feveral cifciimftances \\nforeign to the compofition of the two arcs. Such as, i. The \\nftate of the parts which are fubjeaed to the operation: the \\nfrelher they are, the Wronger are the effeas. 2, The longer \\nor fhorter exercife of Galvanifm : fufeeptibility of Galva¬ \\nnifm is in general excited by exercifing it; is exhaufted by \\ncontinuance, and renewed by repofe. 3. The fucceflion of \\nvarious experiments. A difpofition of metals which at firft \\nhad been inefleaual, has become effeaual after a different \\ndifpofition. Two uncertain experiments are hurtful to each \\nother, and become (till more fo if made in fucceflion. \\n4» I he ftate ol the atmofphere. The atmofphere elecftricj \\nthe animal on which the operation is performed charged \\nand infulated, the effedt is the fame. The whole apparatus \\nplaced under water, the effect remains the fame. \\nV. i here are various artificial means to weaken or revive \\nthe fufeeptibility of Galvanifm. Thus, a frog exhaufted and \\nbrought near to a charged eleffrophorus refumed its fufeep¬ \\ntibility, Alcohol, on the other hand, weakens and even ex-* \\ntinguilhes it fo as never to return* Potaftt produces the \\nfame effect, only flowly. According to M. de Humboldt, \\nthis fufeeptibility is in many cafes reftored by oxygenated \\nmuriatic acid gas. The commiflioners did not obferve this \\ncircumftance j but they propofe to refume the fubjedf, and to \\nrepeat feveral other experiments of that learned philofopher. \\nThey have already repeated thofe on the adion of Galva¬ \\nnifm on the heart, and have obferved, as he did, that its \\naflion is the fame as on fhe voluntary mufcles, and that it \\naccelerates tijeir movement* \\nVox..

Without abandoning \\nthe idea of prefenting to the zeal of philofophers a queftion \\nof fo much importance, the Inftitute has thought proper to \\ndivide it into two branches, and to make it the fubjedl of \\ntwo prizes, by adding to the medal which was to have been \\nadjudged in the year VII, for the whole queftion, that \\nwhich it has at its difpofal for the prefent year- It pro- \\npofes, therefore, as the fubjedl of two prizes, to determine \\nthe fundtions of the liver, feparating what relates to the \\nanatomical ftrudlure of the hepatic fyftem, from what relates \\nto the chemical examination of the liquids and folids be¬ \\nlonging to that fyftem. \\nThe objedl of the firft of thefc prizes will be : the form, \\nfituation, fize, comparative weight, and description of the \\nY 4 tifiue \\n', \"French National Inf it ut e. \\ntiffue of the vefiels, du£ts and appendages of the liver, con- \\nfidered in the principal claffes of animals, from man down \\nto infers, molufcae and worms. \\nThe object of the fecond will be \\\\ an analyfis of the \\nhepatic or cyftic bile in the different claffes of animals as \\nabove mentioned. \\nThe memoirs of thofe who intend to be candidates for one \\nor other of thefe prizes, or for the whole in one effay, \\nmuff be tranfmitted, poft paid, to the fecretary of the clafs \\nof the mathematical and phyfical fciences, before the firfl of \\npjivofe in the year VIII, \\nThe prize for each queffion will be a gold medal of the \\nweight of a kilogramme ; and will be adjudged in the fitting \\nof Germinal 15 th, in the year VIII.

By Cit.

Cit. Guyton, in treating of \\nthe anomalies in affinities, fhewed that thefe apparent devia* \\ntio'ns open to chemilfs a vaft field for new refearches. He \\nexamined why there is no combination between vthe azot and \\noxygen which exift fo abundantly in the atmofphere, and in \\na ft ate of expanfion generally fo favourable to an union. \\nHe likewife pointed out the means of producing it in an \\napparatus capable of fupporting nine or ten times the weight \\nqf the atmofphere. \\n1 he fame chemift employed himfelf alfo in the recipro* \\nical decompofition of falts, at a temperature below freezing $ \\n3 phenomenon * the obfervation of which is of fo much im* \\nv portance \\n\", \"French National Institute. 3 29 \\nportancc in fait works. He difcovered the caufe of it ia \\nthe difengagement of caloric, which becomes a difaggrega- \\ntive power. Since chemifls have extended their refearches \\nto the matter of heat, it is well knovvn that carbon is one of \\nthe weakeft conductors of it. Pyrometrical experiments \\nhave proved to Cit.

Profefior Klaproth, at Berlin, had announced that the \\ncolouring matter of the emerald was iron; but the lalt analyfes \\nof Cit.

He has \\nexamined the different methods of combining that oxyde \\nwith the red of madder, to form a violet colour, and has re¬ \\nduced to fimple principles, operations which were exceed¬ \\ningly complicated.

Cit. Chaptal has ex¬ \\namined what is the adtion of the three principal mordants, \\noil, gall-nuts, and alum, employed in dyeing cotton ; and by \\ndeicribing the mod complex and obfcure operations in dyeing, \\nhy has (hewn what chemiftiy can do towards improving the \\narts, when the practice of it is directed by a fimple and \\nclear theory ^. \\nThe employment of foda is not confined to the dyeing of \\ncotton ; that brought from Spain is of great ufe alfo in foap \\nmanufadlories, glais-houfes for making white glafs, and in \\nbleaching. As France expends annually the fum of four \\nmillions for.that foreign article, it was of importance to en¬ \\ncourage the cultivation of the plant which furnifhes the foda \\nof Alicant. In this refpect Lit. Chaptal and Teffier have \\nbeen of great fervice : the firft, in proving by the experience \\nof many years, that the plant which furnifhes the foda of \\nAlicant may be fuccefsfuliy cultivated on the fouthern coafts \\nof Fiance; and that the foda it produces is abfolutely of the \\nfame quality as that of Spain ; and the fecond, by giving all \\nthe neceffary inffruaions refpeaing the cultivation, and \\nburning of the plant in order to convert it into foda. \\nSome years ago Cit.

We took a glafs bell furnifhed at the top with a \\nbrafs cock, fuch as that ufed for filling bladders with gas, \\nand made tne internal aperture of the cock to communicate \\nwith a fmall tin flute, about fix inches in length. This bell \\nbeing placed in the pneumatic tub, and filled with gas of any \\nkind, a bladder with a cock, and filled with the fame gas as \\nthe bell, was fitted to the cock of the bell, and by preffmg \\nthe bladder gently the flute was made to found. Compara¬ \\ntive experiments were repeated in this manner with atmo- \\nfpheric air, oxygen gas, hydrogen, the carbonic acid, and \\nnitrous gas. The ftrength of the found was always the fame: \\nbut, compared with that in atmofpheric air, the oxygen gas \\ngave half a tone lowei; azotic gas, prepared different ways, \\ngave \\n', \"Experiments on Atmofpheric Air; 33$ \\ngave almoft always a femi-tone lower ; hydrogen gas gave \\nnine or eleven tones higher; the carbonic acid gas a third \\nlower; and the nitrous gas almofl the fame : a mixture of \\noxygen gas and azotic gas, in the proportion of atmofpheric \\nair, gave again the tone of the laid mentioned air, that is to \\nfay, a femi-tone higher than each of the compound gafes \\nalone. As long as the two gafes were not uniformly mixed \\nthere was a frightful difcord. Chladni has promifed to \\npublifh a full account of thefe interefling experiments, \\nwhich differ entirely from thofe of Dr. Prieftley. \\nEXPERIMENTS ON ATMOSPHERIC AIR. \\nOn the 14th inflant, at 7 o’clock in the evening, Cit. \\nGarnerin and Cit. Beauvais afcended in a balloon from the \\ngarden d’Apollon, at Paris. At the height of nearly 40a \\ntoifes Cit. Garnerin let fall a cage, attached to a parachute* \\nand containing a cat, whjch fell very gently near the Port- \\nau-Bled. After 20 minutes the balloon defeended at Nan- \\nteuil, diflant from Paris three leagues. At that place, Cit. \\nBeauvais, aide-de-camp to General Moulins, quitted Cit, \\nGarnerin, who departed at half pafl three in the morning to \\ncomplete his aerial voyage, by taking a long flight. Cit* \\nFrederic Humboldt, a celebrated philofopher, had begged \\nCit. Garnerin to fill with air a fmall flafk with a ground \\nftopper. Cit. Garnerin emptied the water which it con¬ \\ntained at the height of 669 toifes (1303 metres) above: \\nParis. Cit. Beauvais brought back the bottle, filled with \\natmofpheric air, to Cit. Humboldt, who was defirous to know \\nif the carbonic acid gas afeends to fuch elevated regions. \\nThe obfervations of Sauffure, made on the fummit of \\nMount Blanc (at the height of 2.480 toifes), announced its \\ncxiftence there; but this philofopher was in an atrnofphere \\nmodified by the proximity of rocks Cit.

The air col¬ \\nlected by Cit. Garnerin contained only 0,259 of oxygen. \\nThe firft was at 103 degrees, the fecond at 108 of the eu¬ \\ndiometer. The air of the high regions was confequently \\n5 degrees, or 0,017 (alm°ft equal to 0,02) more impure than \\nthe air at the earth’s furface *. T his difference is very \\nconfiderable, when we refleCt that the greateft or lead purity \\nof the atmofphere does not differ near the earth’s furface \\nbut 0,007 of oxygen, \\nMINERALOGY. \\nMr. Donald Stewart, who has been employed for fe- \\nveral years pad: as travelling mineralogift to the Dublin So¬ \\nciety, has lately arrived at Belfaft, after having paffed over, \\nin his lad journey, the counties of Meath, Cavan, Ferma¬ \\nnagh, Donegal!, Derry, and Antrim. He had before ex¬ \\nplored the greateft part of the South and Weft of Ireland. \\nHe has, made many new and curious obfervations, and col¬ \\nlected numerous fpecimens, illuftrating the natural hiftory, \\nand affording materials for the arts, manufactures, and agri¬ \\nculture of that kingdom. \\nThough not educated to thofe purfuits, he has been inde¬ \\nfatigable in his refearches, and fuccefsful in his difcoveries ; \\nand indeed he appears to be the firft perfon who ever at¬ \\ntempted making any general furvey of that ifland with a \\nview to its mineralogy. \\nSome imperfect accounts of the native plants of Ireland \\nhave been publiftied by Rutty, Wade, and fome other gen¬ \\ntlemen, who, during the refidence of Lord Chefterfield as \\nIt is eafy to account for the atmofphere containing more oxygen near \\nthe earth than in the higher regions j the vegetables which grow on its \\nfurface being the principal agents employed by nature to reftore the purity \\nof the atmofpheie: but it is not fo eafy to account for the prefence of \\ncarbonic acid gas at fo great a height.

But as few of his obfervations have hitherto been laid \\nbefore the public, the following extradl from his notes \\nmay prove acceptable to our readers : \\nu I was enabled,” fays Mr. Stewart, <( by difcovering rich \\nquarries of limedone and marie, in feveral eftates where they \\nwere never before known either to tenant or landlord, to be \\nacceflary to the fertilization of the mod barren lands. In \\nthe eftates of Lord Palmerfton and Ormby Jones, Efq. in the \\ncounty of Sligo, I afforded the greateft pleafure and advan¬ \\ntage to the poor inhabitants, by demonftrating to them that \\nthe great rocks, which they called Serpent Rocks, and which \\nthey were gazing at with (Lipid or fuperftitious admiration \\nfor ages, contained mod excellent lime. Thefe quarries are \\nat their doors *, whereas formerly they carried the fcanty pit¬ \\ntance of lime they were able to procure from nine or ten \\nmiles didance. Having turf at home in abundance, they are \\nnow fupplied with lime at as cheap a rate as any people in \\nEurope. \\nI obferved to the pried who accompanied me to the \\nSerpent Rocks, that this mud have been the place to which \\nmy countryman (St. Patrick) had collected all the fetpents \\nof the kingdom. The cliffs extend a mile in front, dip to¬ \\nwards the fea wedward, and run to an indeterminate length \\ninto the country. No block can be raifed in thefe cliffs that \\nis not replete with petrifactions; and the fifh appear to lie \\npromifcuoufly as if thrown out of a net. There may be \\nabout one-twentieth of the whole rock compcfed of thofe \\npetrified fifh or ferpents. The drata or beds are very regu¬ \\nlar, and of different thicknefs.

Rut, inftead of having an opportu¬ \\nnity to obferve this lingular fpecies, which had occupied fo \\nlong and in fo vague a manner the attention of naturalifts \\nand philofophers, and with which, it is faid, Maupertuis \\nwould have preferred two hours converfation to that of the \\nmolt learned focieties .in the world, Wurmb did not even \\nfee an ape of the fpecies of the orang outang. His observa¬ \\ntions, however, are no lefs valuable, fince the objedt of them \\nis not only a new fpecies, but a fpecies of a peculiar form, \\n* For Wurmb’s defe ction of this animal fee page 225, \\nVOL, I, \\n', \"Obfervations on the Ora?ig Qutang. \\nin which are united,, befides the chara&erifmg marks pro¬ \\nper to it, and which are not to be found in any other of the \\nmammalia, fome others very extraordinary which belong to \\nanimals extremely diffimilar. To bring forward then to \\npublic notice a differtation almoil unknown, and on an \\nanimal, which, though defcribed fome time ago, has not yet \\nbeen comprehended in the catalogues or fyftems of natural \\nbeings, is rendering a real fervice to fcience. But this is \\nnot enough : it is neeeffary to prevent that confuiion of \\nnames which is always followed by a confuiion of ideas; \\nfor the defcription of Wurmb, which is not fufficiently \\nample, and which befides is unaccompanied by a figure, \\ndoes not afford natural).fts the means of afcertaining whether \\nthe animal defcribed be rather a new fpecies than the ftongo; \\nand I have been able to determine this point only by com¬ \\nparing the fkeleton of Wurmb’s ape with thofe of different \\n©rang outangs preferred in the collection of the Mufeum of \\nNatural Hiftory. This fkeleton of Wurmb’s ape, one of the \\nmod curious and moll valuable in the national cclleCficn, \\nwill furnifh us with very important obfervations, that may \\nferve to give a better idea of the fpecies in queftion, than a \\ndefcription of the external parts. (See Plate XI.) \\nThis animal, in the fcale of beings, occupies aim oft the \\nJaft rank in the numerous family of the apes. The lingular \\nconformation of its head places it between the mandrils \\n(Jimia mawiGn et mormon l) and the allouates {jimia J'eni- \\nculus). However, if, without fixing on this charaHeriiing \\nmark, though of great importance, we adhere to thofe ac¬ \\ncording to which fyftematic authors have formed for apes \\nwen era ami dwijions, the want of a tail will make it an \\nanimal nearly related to the gibbons and orang outangs. \\nBut 1 do not think it neeeffary to endeavour to prove that \\nthe latter mark is very mfufficxent to point out the real \\naffinity of beings. A tail is a fuperfluous appendage, and \\nalmoff foreign to the bodies of animals. This organ can in \\nno cafe have any influence on their economy, nor even on \\ntheir \\n\", \"Oibfervcitions on the Orang Outang, 339 \\ntheir habits. We might as well fay that fome fpecies of \\nthe genera of the lemur, cav'ia, erinaccus, &c. which have no \\ntail, are fimilar to the orang outangs ; which would be an \\nabfurdity. On the contrary, in a family like that of the \\niap'es, where all the principal organs exhibit no remarkable \\nnumerical difference, and where the teeth, fingers and \\ntongue have a perfect refemblance, the form of the cranium \\nis the molt important confideration in examining the real \\naffinity of thefe animals, and may ferve as a bafis for their \\ngeneric divifiohs; fince it appears that the fize and convexity \\nof the cranium indicate fenfibility, as the prolongation and \\nfize of the muzzle indicate brutality. \\nBut what is moft linking in the fkull of Wurrrftfs ape is \\nthe exceffive prolongation of the muzzle; and as this muzzle \\nacquires fuch a bulk only at the expence of other neighbour¬ \\ning parts, it happens that there is no apparent forehead $ \\nthat the offeous box which inclofes the brain is very fmall, \\nand that the occipital foramen is fituated in the pofterior \\npart of the head. The muzzle, the fize of which feems to \\nform the principal charadterifing mark of this fpecies, is re¬ \\nmarkable not only for the enormous thicknefs of the jaw¬ \\nbones, but alfo for the extraordinary bulk of the inciffve \\nand Canine teeth with which it is armed. The inciffve ex¬ \\nceed in fize thofe of the lion; and the canine, in that refpedl, \\nare not much different: fo that, thoup-h thefe inciffve and \\ncanine teeth, except in bulk, have a near refemblance to \\nthofe of other apes, wre are tempted to confound the head of \\nthe one in queftion with that o,f the moft carnivorous ani¬ \\nmals. Another confideration feems in fome manner to fup- \\nport this affinity. The occiput rifes to a point, and forms a \\npretty large and thick quadrilateral protuberance, from \\nwhich arife three offeous ridges, no lefs apparent and no lefs \\nfolid than thofe of the lion : twro of thefe ridges proceed in a \\nlateral direction to the auricular apertures, and have from \\nfour to five lines of elevation; another proceeds to the ver¬ \\ntex, then divides itfelf above the forehead, like that of the \\nZ 2, lion. \\n\", '2^,0 Obfervatlons on the Orang ()utang, \\nlion, into two lateral branches, and continues to the external- \\nfide of the upper edge of the orbits. Thefe fmall ridges are \\nmore diftind in the ape of Wurmb, and form, with the \\nupper edge of the fockets of the eye, an equilateral triangle. \\nBut thefe charaderiflng marks, already fo lingular in this \\nape, will aftonilh us Hill more by their combination with \\nothers at leak equally ft range. The head has the form of \\nhalf a pyramid, and the auricular apertures are placed far \\nabove the os palatinus 5 fo that a line let fall from the auri¬ \\ncular apertures to the internal edge of the os -palatinus would \\nform, at the point of its interfcdion-with the horizontal line, \\nan angle of 25°.- This has been already obferved in the \\nallouate, where fueh a lingular conformation is neceftary on \\naccount ol an extraordinary fvvelling of the os hioides. \\nThe anatomical reader will, no doubt, be perfuaded, after \\nwhat I have faid, that the ape of Wurmb can in no cafe \\nfupport itfelf on its two hind legs, but that it mult always go \\non all-fours. It is, indeed, on the pofition of the occipital \\nforamen, according to the learned obfervations of Dauben- \\nton, that the greater or lefs degree of aptitude for walking \\nupright chiefly depends. In man, whofe occipital foramen \\nis nearly in the centre of the bale of the cranium, the head \\nis placed on the vertebral column in an alrnoft perfed equi¬ \\nlibrium ; but if the occipital foramen is removed backwards, \\nand particularly to that point where it is obferved in the ape \\nof Wurmb, the equilibrium is deftroved: the weight of \\nthe head carries with it the body, and obliges the animal to \\nuie for its iupport, and for walking, thole anterior extremities \\nwhich in man ferve only for gralping. \\nBefore we can draw any conclulion on this point, in re¬ \\ngard to the ape of Wurmb, and before we affirm, that, ac¬ \\ncording to the pofition of its occipital foramen, it cannot \\nwalk on two legs, let us confider it in its whole organifatiom \\nWe are not yet acquainted with all the immenfe refources \\nof nature. We do not yet know to what decree it can eri- \\nlarge, and render ufeful, organs the rudiments of which only \\nexift \\n', '/ \\nOhfervations on the Orang Out ang. 341 \\nfcxlft in the greater part of animals to compenfate for others \\nwhich fhe may have rendered too prominent. Bat, indeed, \\nall the reft of the organifation of the ape of Wurmb an¬ \\nnounces a biped animal.

This laft \\nchara&eriling mark, to which no attention has hitherto \\nbeen paid, appears to me one of the fureft indications of a \\nbiped walk. Apes muft take advantage of the great length \\nof their anterior extremities, by extending them in all di¬ \\nrections ; they muft make ufe of them as of a balancing pole \\nto keep themfelves in equilibrium, or to reftore themfelves to \\nit when they have been expofed to a fall which obliges them \\nto make only a gentle inclination of the body. \\nIn a word, a particular organifation re&ifies the difad- \\nvantages which refult, in walking erect, from the length of \\nthe muzzle, and the pofition of the occipital foramen being \\nremoved farther back. In all the known mammalia, the \\nfpinal apophyfes of the cervical vertebrae are fhorter than \\nthofe of the lumbar and dorfal vertebra?. 1 he cafe is the re¬ \\nverie in the ape of Wurmb ; and, according to the judicious \\nremark of Cuvier, thefe apophyfes of the cervical vertebrae \\nhave this great length, to form more powerful and more nu¬ \\nmerous bonds with the large mufcles of the neck which pro¬ \\nceed on the occipital ridges. Tbus nature by another me- \\nchanifm has provided for the fupport of the head of W urmb s \\nape on the fpinal column; and by thefe means it can keep \\nitfelf erect, and run in that pofture. \\nI (hall not purfue any farther an explanation of the cha¬ \\nracter 1 ling marks which it exhibits to naturahfts. r have \\nfaid enough to prove that it is not the orang outang or \\npongo, but that it ought to be conftdered as a Ipeeies un¬ \\nknown before the publication of W urmb’s memoir.

Account of the Methods, employed in Japan and Chma to, \\nprepare Soy, with fome Obfervations on the Bean from \\nwhich it is produced. By Brofeffor BECKMANN. \\nHP \\n1 HIS article, which is a brown faline liquor, imported tq \\nEurope from the Eafl Indies, is employed for feafoning va¬ \\nrious kinds of difhes, and improving the tafle of different \\nfauces. It is brought from Japan in fmall wrooden veffels, \\nand alfo from China and other parts of India in glafs flafks, \\nfeveral of wrhich are packed together in a wooden box. \\nThe ufe of it has been long general in the Eafl Indies; \\nwhere it is placed on the table at each meal, inflead of fait, \\nfor the purpofe of dipping in it fiefh, fifh, and other kinds \\nof food. \\nThe Japanefe are faid to be the inventors of this article; \\nand, at prefent, their foy is preferred to any other; though it \\nis afferted by connoiffeurs that this preference arifes more \\nfrom the price than the goodnefs. In my opinion, it was \\nfull introduced in the European commerce in the prefent \\ncentury; for it is not to be found in the old catalogues of \\n.goods; in Saavary’s or LudoviciT dictionaries, nor in the \\nold books on cookery. The firfl account of the method of \\npreparing it after the Japanefe manner was publifhed by \\nKempfer, \\nBefore \\n\", 'Method employed to prepare Soy. 343 \\nBefore I give a defcription of this method, it may not he \\nimproper to inform the reader that the people in India, in- \\nhead of our common kidney beans, cultivate and ufe as \\nfood another fpecies of a fimilar kind, called in botany do- \\nlichos, and which comprehends feveral fpecies. Among \\nthefe there is one called dolichos -foy a. This plant is all over \\nrough; and its weak Item rifes to the height of a man. Its \\nflowers, which are final!, fcarcely appear above the calyx, \\nand arc of a blueifh or almoft violet colour. The rough \\nhulks contain for the mod: part only two feeds, which in \\nform, fize and tafte differ very little from our garden peafe, \\nexcept that they are flatted, fhaped lb me what like an egg, \\nand have a black fpeck at the place where they begin to \\ngerminate^. \\nThefe feeds form the principal component part of foy. In \\nJapan they are fkft boiled, and then mixed with the fame \\nquantity of barley or wheat meal (the latter is for the pur- \\npofe of giving the foy a darker colour); and the mixture, \\nbeing covered up, is depofited for twenty-four hours in a \\nwarm place, where it ferments. The fame quantity of com¬ \\nmon fait, with the like quantity and half as much water, is \\nthrown over it; and the whole mafs, for the fpace of two \\nor three months, is llirred round daily with a chocolate flick, \\nand elofely covered immediately after. At the expiration of \\nthat period it is drained or fqueezed through a linen cloth, \\nand the liquor, which is preferred in wooden veflels, be¬ \\ncomes always clearer and better the longer it is kept. The \\nmafs which remains is again fubjedted to a like procefs by \\nhaving water poured over it, and, being ftirred round for \\nfome days, as before, is then ft rained. \\n* Hilum fufeum.

Method employed to prepare Soy. \\nOf the preparation in China the following account has \\nbeen given by Eckberg, a Swede*: Thirty-five pounds of \\nthefe beans, clean wafhed, are boiled for a few minutes with \\nwater in a covered veffel, until they can be eafily preffed to¬ \\ngether between the fingers. They are then put into a fieve; \\nand when they are hill moift, after the water has run oft, \\nthey are ftirred round in fine meal, made of the fame beans, \\nuntil they are completely covered by it. They are then put \\ninto fmall fieves, or laid upon fmooth mats to the height \\nof an inch and a half above each other, and are depofited in \\na bafket covered with mats, where they are differed to remain \\nthree or four days till they begin to grow mouldy. They are \\nthen tirft expofed to the air, and afterwards dried in a ftrong \\nfun-heat, or in a warm place, until they can bear the flroke \\nof a hammer 3 when they are rubbed between the hands, and \\nin that manner freed from the meal and mouldinefs with \\nwhich they are covered. They are then thrown into earthen \\nveflels, and a pickle compofed of 20 pounds of fait and 100 \\npounds of fpring water is poured over them. Thefe earthen \\nveflels are expofed open during the day to the fun, but at \\nnight they are covered; or they are put in fome warm place, \\nfor the fpace of fix weeks, until their whole fubftance be well \\nextracted. When it is obferved that the pickle has become \\nthick and of a dark brown colour, it is poured off, and boiled \\nfeveral times in order to render it thicker. Some, during \\nthefe boilings, add to it fugar, ginger and other fpices ac¬ \\ncording to pleafure, leaving the whole to ftand for a few \\ndays ; after which it is drained. \\nFrom what has been above (aid, it may be readily per¬ \\nceived that the preparation of foy in Europe would be at¬ \\ntended with no difficulty if it were poffible to cultivate the \\nbeans. Bergius, however, gives his countrymen little hope \\nthat this can be done; and chiefly for this realbn, that the \\nplant blows fo late in green-houfes, that the dimmer is gone \\nbefore the fruit can ripen. But this is often the cafe with \\n* Abfiaadlungen der Schwedifchen Acad, xxvi. p, 40. \\nexotics \\n', \"Method employed to prepare Soy.

On the other hand, when they \\nare tranfplanted into foil lbmewhat poorer, and into an open \\nplace where they have lefs fhelter, they do not grow fo quick \\nand fo long; but they blow earlier. And hence it happens, \\nthat many exotics planted in the open air produce ripe feeds, \\nwhich could never be. obtained from them while they were \\npreferved as curiofities and favourites of the gardener in \\ngreen-houfes. I confider it, therefore, as an experiment worth \\nmaking, to plant thefe beans in the open fields; and I am \\ninclined to think that in many fummers they would pro¬ \\nduce ripe feeds, efpeeially as Jacquin fays exprefsly that they \\nthrove well at Vienna in the open air. \\nShould my conjedlure, however, be not realifed, this \\nwould not, at any rate, be the cafe with that of Bergius, \\nwho is of opinion that a kind of foy might be obtained from \\nour peas and beans by the fame or a finnlar proceis ; but in¬ \\ndeed it would have this great fault, that it would be too cheap, \\nand too foon become common. \\nIII. Comparative Viezv of the expanfive Force of the Steam \\nof Water and that of Alcohol. By R. Pro NT.

The fir A ferved to \\nintroduce the fluid into the boiler, and could be clofely fluit \\nby means of a fcrew.. The feeond was occupied by a ther¬ \\nmometer, having its ball about two inches above the bottom \\nof the boiler, and the fcale, which was on the outfide,. con¬ \\ntained from o to no0 of Reaumur. To- the third was \\nadapted a bent barometric tube, having two lines of internal \\ndiameter, the afccnclmg branch of which was no inches in \\nlength. \\nBy means- of a lateral cock a communication was elia- \\nblilhed between the boiler and an air pump, which ferved to \\nmake a. vacuum before a fire was kindled in the furnace \\nbelow the apparatus. This cireumftance of evaporation in \\na vacuum, forms an eflential difference, between the experi¬ \\nments of Bettencourt and thofe made before bv Ziegler, and \\nlenders them applicable to the theory of the fleam-engine^ \\nwhere the vapour a fits in a fpace fixed from air* \\n* fo *his fecund volume will be found experiments made cm the fame \\nand communicated to me by their author John Henry Ziegler. \\n1 hey were published- at Bn fie in *769, in a memoir entitled : Specimen \\nfbyjlco- cbemictem de dig efore Pap-ini, ejm JhxRxrd, effeRu st pjtt, peimi- \\niras experimenter nv* mvorum circa Jluidornm a cohere rarefa&tmem tt \\n’vnporum elaflickalem ex,bihem. Bet tan court, who did not fee them till he \\nbad finifhed his own, mentions them in his memoir. It will be perceived, \\nby the account I have given of them, that they deprive him of none o£ \\nthat glory which he has a right to expect from his labours. \\nA w \\n', \"and that of Alcohol, \\nA vacuum having been made In the boiler, the mercury \\nbrought as nearly as poffible to a level in the two branches \\npf the barometric tube, and the thermometer reduced to \\nzero by means of ice, the ice was removed, and a fire was \\nkindled, which was excited gently and with much equality, \\nin fuch a manner that the barometer paffed over about a \\ndegree per minute. One perfon then flood by to obferve the \\nbarometer, and another to obferve the thermometer, and \\neach kept a regifler from degree to degree of the preffure \\nand correfponding temperatures; the preffure being expreffed \\nby the height in (French) inches of the columns of mercury, \\nwhich rofe above the level in the long branch of the baro¬ \\nmeter. \\nIt was exceedingly difficult to prevent either the introduc¬ \\ntion of air into the boiler, or the extravafation of vapour, \\naccording as the internal preffure was lefs or greater than \\nthe weight of the atmofphere : means, however, were found \\nto obviate thefe inconveniencies; but they are too long to be \\ndetailed here, and muff be read in the works before men¬ \\ntioned. \\nThe observations of the expanfive force of the fleam of \\nwater furnifh no refults, proceeding from degree to degree \\nof the thermometer, and beginning at zero.

The expence of movement in & \\nfleam engine is compounded of the price of the fluid evapo¬ \\nrated and that of the fuel. The ufe of water requires no \\nfarther expence than that of the fubftance employed as fuel; \\nbut it is poffible that fome other fluids much dearer in itfelf, \\nmay neverthelefs have fuch expandon, that with an equality \\nof preifure the faving in fuel may be greater than the price \\nof the fluid. If the remits from the fleam of alcohol be \\ncompared with thofe from the fleam of water, it will be feen \\nthat, at the fame temperature, the expanfive force of the \\nfleam of the former is always more than double that of the \\nlatter. Much lefs fuel then will be neceflary to produce in \\na fleam-engine the fame effedt by alcohol; and if the ap¬ \\nparatus were difpofed in fuch a manner as not to lofe the \\ncondenfed liquor, which would be attended with no great \\ndifficulty, it might be ufcd with much advantage in certain \\ncafes, and in engines of fmail dimenfions. But, according to \\nevery appearance, there are other fluids lefs expendve than \\nalcohol, which may have an equal or even a greater expand on; \\nand it would be a very ufeful objedl of refearch to determine \\nthe mechanical effedt of which fleam is fufceptible, and to \\ngive tables on that fubjecl, flmilar to that here prefented in \\nregard to water and alcohol. \\nThe refults given by experiments, of the expandve force \\nof the fleam of alcohol at different temperatures, are ex- \\npreffed in the fame manner in the following table, as thofe \\ngiven by the experiments on the fleam of water. \\nTable \\n', 'L 349 3 \\nTable of the ISiX^cinJive Force of the Strain of iv A TER \\nand of Alcohol. \\nTemperature. \\nKeaum.

FURTHER PROPERTIES OF THE OXYGENATED* \\nMURIATOF IRON. \\nHp ' \\nA H E facts T have related are unqueffionable: it was hi \\nthe latter end of 1795 that I firft made the obfervation on the \\neffect of hepatifed water upon iron: fmce then I have veri¬ \\nfied it repeatedly, and particularly in the month of Decem¬ \\nber 1796, with fome very pure iron, and in the prefence of \\ntwo gentlemen, very competent judges, one of whom affifted \\nat every part of the procefs. Still it has been afked, How is \\nit poffible that this folution can contain muriatic acid, feeing \\nthat nitrat of filver, that molt delicate teft of this acid, is \\nhardly affected by it ? To this it might perhaps be a fufficicnt \\nreply, that it is unreafonable to oppofe a mere analogy to \\nthe dir eft evidence of the fenfes $ particularly in a new cafe, \\nwhere we have found fome of the analogies bed efiablifhed in \\nchemifiry to fail. But let us recur once more to experiment. \\nI formed again fome oxygenated muriat of iron. I differed \\nthe acid to remain on the oxyde about 24 hours; then poured \\noff the liquor, and evaporated the fait to drynefsto expel 1 the \\nfuperfluous acid : the fait, which deliquefces inftantly on \\ncooling, was re-diffolved in a little diftilled water. 1. i tried \\nthe folution with the acetite of lead: not the fmalleff cloud \\nwas produced. 2. The folution was then tried with the \\nnitrat of filver: a little white curdy matter was formed. \\n3. A tea-fpoonful of the folution was diffufed through two or \\nthree ounces of diftilled water, and then tried with the nitrat \\nof filver: a very flight cloud was formed, and a minute purple \\nprecipitate fell, but not till after fome hours.

The fir ft is absolutely con- \\nclulive: as to the final! appearance of decomposition in \\nExp. % and 3, be it considered how difficult it is to prevent a \\nminute quantity of common acid from palling over in the \\ndiftillation of the oxygenated acid; and how readily this acid \\nitfelf is decompofed: add to this the i roper feed oxydation, \\nperhaps, of the iron. If thefe circumfiances are duly weigh¬ \\ned, it feems probable, that this fait, when quite pure, would \\nnot. at all fenfibly decompose niirat of Silver. A flight im¬ \\npurity cannot be detedbed by acetite of lead, as a Small quan¬ \\ntity of muriat of lead is Soluble in water. \\nXII.. FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS ON THE HEPA- \\nTISED SOLUTIONS. \\n.Befides the oxygenated Salts, I think it probable, that \\nthefe folutions retain Some Sulphur; but under what form, \\nor in what combination, it is not eafy to fay. The refiduum, \\nafter evaporation, has a peculiar fmell, whereas the pure \\nlaits are inodorous. The flain left upon Silver by the refi- \\nduum ought, perhaps, to be attributed to this caufe. Alfo, \\nthe white matter formed by the decomposition of oxygenated \\nmuriat of mercury feems to be a combination of fulphur \\nand rhercury. In proof of this it may be remarked, that \\nthe precipitate of this fait diffoived in Simple hepaiifed wa¬ \\nter is white. Further, it is doubtlefs true, that if hepatifed \\n'water have a fmall quantity of acid mixed with it, the folu- \\ntion of iron (hikes a purple colour with galls. To point opt \\nthe origin of this colour, mix iron Slings and fulphur not \\nwaffied, and form them into a pafte with a little water, and \\n.let them remain together for feme hours : put the. pafte in¬ \\nto water, and filtrate: this water now Strikes a purple colour \\nwith \\n\", \"35$ An Analyfis of two Mineral Springs \\nwith galls. Now, common fulphur is always contaminated \\nwith a little fulphuric acid; and, as neither hepatic gas nor' \\noxygenated fait is here concerned, the effect muff be at¬ \\ntributed to the acid and the fulphur. If this water be eva¬ \\nporated, it leaves a matter which does not deliquefee; but \\nwhich emits the fame fmell as the refiduum of the hepatifed \\nfolutions. To fhew that the acid is neceffafy to the pro¬ \\nduction of the purple colour, let the fulphur be well waffled \\nwith diffilled water before it is mixed with the iron; and it \\nwill be found that no fuch colour can be now produced. \\nThe following fact feems to prove that fulphur may be re¬ \\ntained in -water, in the form neither of fulphur nor of hepatic \\ngas: it is an additional proof how effentially the oxygenated \\ndiffers from all the common falls of iron. I faturated a di¬ \\nluted folution of oxygenated muriat of iron, which fcarcely \\naffedted nitrat of filver, with hepatic gas. A white preci¬ \\npitate fell, but fo minute that it was impoffible to collect it, \\nnor did it deftroy the tranfparency of the water: hence I \\nthink it probable that, if the fait were quite perfedh it would \\nnot be fenfibly affected by hepatic gas'. I now boiled the \\nliquor, to expell the gas, till it wholly loft its hepatic fmell. \\nThe liquor,was again tried with nitrat of fflver; and there \\nwas a copious depofition, but of a dark brownifh colour. \\nIt feems certain, then, that fome fulphur is retained by the \\nfolution, which cannot be expelled by boiling. \\nXIII. THE NEUTRAL SALTS OF THE WATER: MURIAT \\nV- ’ ' i , * • ■ • \\nOF MAGNESIA, MURIAT OF SODA, SULPHAT OF \\nSODA. \\nA gallon of the water was evaporated to drynefs; the de- \\nliquefcent falts were feparated from the non-deliquefeent; \\nand each of the falts which were thus obtained was care¬ \\nfully examined. Thus, by procefies which are fufficiently \\nknown, it was found that the gallon of water contains of \\nmuriat of magnefia 11.5 grains nearly; muriat of foda 430 \\ngrains; fulphat of foda 15$ grains. \\nThe \\n\", \"Lemingtbii Priors 0 £££ \\nThe triple compound of which I have treated, is mixed \\nvirith the deliquefcent fait of magnefia, but not wholly $ for \\nit may be difcovered with the ndn-deliquefcent falts, though* \\nthefe have been fepara'ted carefully by fpirit of wine. The \\ntartrite of potafh indicates it in both. Oxalic acid does the \\nfame thing, feparating a white powder with fome cryftalline \\ngrains which are the oxalat of manganefe. (gee Bergman/ \\nDiffer!. vhi. 24.) \\nTHE RESIDUUM OP DIFFICULT SOLUTION* \\nAfter thefe falts had been fcparatcd there remained a large \\nfefiduum, which was not foluble except in a great quantity \\nOf water. This has a cryftalline form like fulphat of lime/ and \\nthe ufual reagents fftewed it, i'nfadt, to contain bothTime and \\nfulphurie acid. But the weight of this refiduum, from aT \\ngallon of water, Was no lets than 112 grains: a larger quan¬ \\ntity than could be diffolved in a gallon of water, if it were \\npure fulphat of lime. If it be confidered that the water re¬ \\nquires fame evaporation' before thefe cryftals begin to fkpa- \\nrate, the proportion is ftill more increafed. There mhft bey \\ntherefore, fomething peculiar in the compofition of the falt^ \\nor in the foluble powers of the water. Other experiments \\nfhew the fame thing, x. Sulphuric acid dropped into the \\nwater precipitates copioufly fulphat of lime. This cannot \\nbe effected by the decompofition of the muriat of Iim6 j \\nfince we have already feen that no fuch fait is to be \\nfound (xiii.). Indeed it cannot exift in the fame foiution \\nwith falphat of foda, as thefe falts decompofe each other*/ \\n2. Sometimes a more unexpedted appearance than this-' \\nIt is aftonifiling that this fa£t fhould have been neglefted, and that in \\nrecent publications. Mr. Schmeiffer, inhisanalyfisofthewatersofK.il-, \\nburn Wells (Phil. Tranfac.), has joined together fulphat of foda, fulphaf \\nof magnefia, and muriat of lime, as being contained in thefe waters. Dr. \\nvjarnetthas alfo put into the compofition of the fulphur-well afHarrowgate \\nfulphat of magnefia and muriat of lime ; an error the more unaccountable, \\n3s Bergman has expreflly remarked this decompofition m his Diff-rtatiori \\non the Analyfis of Waters, See Differt. ii. 7. M. \\nYol, I, A 9: ' fck®# \\n\", '354 Ain Analyjis of two Mineral Springs \\ntakes place; It is, that a precipitate, feemingly like the \\nformer, has been made by the addition of the muriatic acid^. \\nbut by the addition of more acid the precipitate is re-dif- \\nfolved. Sometimes, indeed moft commonly, I have not \\nbeen able to effect this appearance. \\nIt was natural to expedl the folution of any further un¬ \\ncommon obfervation in the fame matter that had already \\nexplained fo much. 3. I accordingly digefted fuiphat ot \\nlime in the hepatifed folutions of iron and manganefe; and \\nI found that the latter had a very ftrong folvent power. Af¬ \\nter the liquor had been filtered, fuiphat of lime was plenti¬ \\nfully precipitated by fulphuric acid. The folution of iron \\nfeems to have fomething of a fimilar property ; but as it is \\nvery (mall, and as iron has almoft always a little manganefe \\nunited with it, it is at lead uncertain whether the whole \\neffect ought not to be attributed to manganefe. \\nIt remains to compare this remark with the effects of the \\nartificial oxygenated falts; and thus to confirm, if confirma¬ \\ntion were needed, the analogy which I have laboured to \\nefiablifh. 4. Sulphat of lime was digefted with the oxyge¬ \\nnated muriat of manganefe and diftilled water by a gentle \\nheat: after 24 hours the clear liquor was feparated : into \\nthis I dropped a little fulphuric acid; by degrees a large \\nquantity of fuiphat of lime was feparated. Muriatic acid \\nwas dropped into the fame liquor, but it did not feparate any \\nthing* The oxygenated muriat of iron pofTeffed the fame \\nproperty, but in fo fmall a degree, that here again I am in¬ \\nclined to attribute this power to a little manganefe attached \\nto the iron. It follows from thefe fa&s, that the large quan¬ \\ntity of fuiphat of lime is kept in folution by the fait of man¬ \\nganefe* And a further examination of the refiduum itfelf \\nfliews that it contains the triple fait of manganefe and iron. \\n5* Some of the refiduum was perfectly edulcorated, and ful¬ \\nphuric acid was dropped upon it; the vapours of muriatic \\nacid arofe, and were rendered evident by paper moifienecl \\n^ith ammoniac or with fun pic water. To the fulphuric \\nacid. \\n', 'at Lcrhington Priors. \\\\ \\\\ 5^5 \\nadd., which was ufed in this experiment, was added fome \\ndiftilled water, and the liquor was filtrated: it was then \\nfaturated with an alkali; a fmall precipitate fell, which was \\nproved (by the ufual methods) to contain both manganefe \\nand iron. \\n6. I have noticed a variation (2.) in the effe£t of muriatic \\njLcid when added to the water. I have obferved a fimjlar va¬ \\nriety in the refiduum itfelf 5 which is, that fometimes it has \\nbeen found foluble in the muriatic acid: when this happens, \\nthe addition of an alkali precipitates the refiduum in its ori¬ \\nginal cryflalline form; and this it does before the acid is fa- \\nturated. But moft commonly the muriatic acid does not \\ndiflolve it at all. Further, it has been faid above (vii. 1.) \\nthat the acids precipitate a cryftalline fubftance from oxyge¬ \\nnated muriat of iron. This fubftance I have found to con¬ \\ntain manganefe. But what belongs to this place to obferve \\nis, that it is not always, indeed it is but rarely, that this ef- \\nfe& can be produced in any great degree: in a very fmall \\ndegree it may always be obferved; but, when I firft remarked \\nit, the precipitate was very copious, fo that enough was \\nreadily colle&ed for examination by the blow-pipe. The \\nfait of manganefe does not {hew this appearance in the \\nfmallefi: degree. It depends, therefore, on fome peculiarity \\nof the iron ruft, but precifely on what I cannot take upon \\nme to determine. \\nAs the oxygenated falts unite with all the other falts of \\nthe water, and confequently cannot be feparated by fpirit of \\nwine, I have found it impoffible to determine the quantity \\nof them. \\nI had concluded from the experiment (1.) that this water \\ncontained muriat of lime; and the following remark con¬ \\nfirmed me in my error: I mention it, as I think it probable \\nthat others have been led into miftakes from the fame caufe. \\nI reduced fome of the water, by evaporation, to about two \\n«unce-meafures 5 taking for granted that by this procefs \\nA a % nearly \\n', '356 An Andlyjls of two Mineral Spring! \\nnearly the whole of the fulphat of lime was feparated. Bf \\nadding fulphuric acid to this liquor, 20 grains of fulphat of \\nlime were precipitated. I concluded, therefore, that this \\nniuft have proceeded from the decompofition of muriat of \\nlime: in truth, this fulphat was diffolved in the two ounces \\nmealures of water, and was feparated by the decompofition \\nof the oxygenated fait. \\nON THE WATER OF THE OLD BATHS. \\nThe fpring which fupplies thefe baths was difcovered in \\n1786, in which year a cold and a warm bath were con- \\nft rubied. Upon linking the well, a rock was found at the \\ndepth of eighteen feet; and the water riles from about the \\ndepth of three feet within the rock. \\n» i \\nXV. THE GASEOUS FLUIDS, \\n» \\nI could obtain very little gas from this water, not more \\nthan three cubic inches from a gallon. It was azotic. An \\nhepatic fmell is perceptible when the water is frefh. To the \\nhepatic gas, doubtlefs, it is owing, that no oxygen is found \\nin this water or in that of the other fpring. . Dr. Garnett \\nhas fo well explained the caufe of this cireumftance, that it is \\nneedlefs for me to enter upon it. (See Dr. G. on the Mi¬ \\nneral Waters of Harrowgate, p. 74, See.) \\nXVI. THE SPONTANEOUS PRECIPITATE.-, \\nThis water is pellucid when it iirft rifes from the fpring ; \\nin fmall quantities it does not lofe its tranfparency: a very \\nfmall fediment is depofited by boiling, fo fmall indeed that \\nfufficient cannot be collected in-this way for .examination. \\nHowever, when the bath has been newly filled, in fome hours \\nthe tranfparency of this large body of water is deftroyed byex- \\npofure to the atmosphere, and it contracts a whitifh colour. I \\ncollected a large quantity of this precipitate from the bottom of\\nthe bath, where it by degrees accumulates, x. I fir ft attempted \\nIts analyfis by acids, but was difappointed. It is hardly foluble\\n', 'at JLemmgton Priors* gsjy \\n3ri any of the mineral acids: they all take up a little of it, \\nmake a brifk effervefcence, and excite heat when firfl ap¬ \\nplied ; but neither by a long digeftion, nor by boiling, could \\nI faturate the acids; nor, by putting a very fmall quantity of \\nthe powder into a large quantity of acid, could I completely \\ndiffolve the powder. \\n2. But by the ufe of the blow-pipe it readily appeared \\nthat this fediment is no other than the oxydes of the two \\nmetals fo frequently mentioned, iron and manganefe. It \\nmay be made magnetic j it gives the hyacinth ine colour to \\nborax j the colour is deftroycd by continuing the fulion, and \\nmay be renewed by removing the globule to a filver fpoon; \\niufed with foda and nitre it makes a blue or a green globule. \\nAs the fediment may be procured in fufficient quantity, I \\n.repeated the laft experiment on a larger fcale: fome nitre \\nbeing mixed with it, the mafs was pulverifed, and fufed in a \\ncrucible; when taken out of the fire it was green, and dif- \\nfolved in water, to which alfo it imparted a fine green co¬ \\nlour : in a day or two a yellow ochre was depofited, when \\nthe folution became blue; from this liquor a powder fub- \\nfided by expofure to the air, which was manganefe. (See \\nScheele’s Effay on Mang. xxxvi. B. \\n3* Burfuing the obfervations of the effects of the mineral \\nacids confirms this conclufion, I mixed fome of the fedi¬ \\nment with powdered charcoal, and expofed the mixture to a \\nftrong red heat: it became of a light brown colour, and \\nnow proved to be readily foluble in all the mineral acids. \\n.(See Scheele’s Effay on Manganefe, xxxviii. A.) With \\nthe muriatic and nitric it formed a gelatinous compound. \\nThe fulphuric acid, diluted, was foon faturated; the liquor \\nwas evaporated, and depofited white cryftals, the form of \\nwhich is rhomboidal. This is a triple fait, the bafe of \\nwhich is iron and manganefe. If there be a fmall excefs of \\nAcid, the -tafte is very like that of fulphat of argil!. The fame \\nfait may be obtained by boiling the fulphuric acid with the \\nfediment itfelf, and continuing the boiling till the mafs is be- \\nA a 3 come \\n', '358 An Andlyfis of two Mineral Springs \\ncome dry: the fait may then be procured by lixiviating the \\ndry mafs, and cryftallifing the folution. \\nXVII. \\nNeither fulphat of argill nor oxygenated liiuriat of mer¬ \\ncury is at all decompofed by this water. \\nXVIII. THE METALLIC SALTS. \\nAll the appearances which demonftrate the exiftencc of \\npeculiar metallic falts in the waters of the new baths are alfo \\nto be found in this : as, the oxydation and folution of metals \\nand a copious precipitate by galls, while the prufliat of potr \\nafh is not affeded (iv.) s and the fame experiments were \\nrepeated to {hew the prefence of the oxygenated falts of iron \\nand manganefe (v. vii. &c.) with the fame refult, and au- \\nthorife the fame conclufions. Still I believe there is fome \\ndifference in regard to thefe falts between the two waters. \\nI. I have already obferved (xvii.) two points of diflindion; \\nand, as the fecond of thofe experiments is probably an in¬ \\ndication of fulphur, this water feems to be without it. This \\nis confirmed by evaporating the water in a filver veffel, to \\nwhich it communicates no {lain. However, s. Its adion \\non copper is very flrong, fo that, if it be boiled in a copper \\nveffel for a long time, a blue oxyd of copper is feparated \\nfrom the veffel. But here, again, there is a difference be¬ \\ntween this and the former water; for, though copper is dif- \\nfolved in it, none can be precipitated on iron in its metallic \\nform, as we have feen (iv. i.). The iron in this water does \\nnot feem to be in that high degree of oxygenation that it is \\nin the other. This I infer, becaufe, 3. the precipitate formed \\nby tindure of galls is of a much darker colour, even when \\nthe water has been much evaporated : fometimes, when the \\nwater has been reduced to half its original bulk, I have re¬ \\nmarked even a very flight green tinge communicated by |\\nprufliat of potafli, but not till it has been added to it many \\nhours. \\n', \"At Lemlngton Priors* $$$ \\nAs the oxygenated falls are formed by the a&icn of hepa¬ \\ntic gas on the metals, it cannot be doubted that they are \\nvery common. Bergman (Diflert, vir. 6.) obferves, “that \\ncold martial waters, when frefli, almoft always have an he¬ \\npatic finel'lit feems very probable then that this fait of \\niron may be found in almoft all fuch waters, I doubt not \\nthat it has been frequently miftaken for muriat of lime, to \\nwhich in its properties it approaehes very nearly, \\nThough I have purpofely avoided all medical difeuffion in \\nthis eftay, I cannot abftain from bellowing a moment’s con* \\nfideration on one very obvious queftion. What, it will be \\nafked, are the medical properties of manganefe ? Is it ufefuD \\nIs it innocent ? Is it noxious ? That it is innoxious I cer¬ \\ntainly know. Dr. John Johnftone (Eftay on Mineral Poi- \\nfons, page 134.) has fhewn that it maybe taken in large \\ndofes.without injury; and he has informed me, that he has \\nfince confirmed the fame fact frequently. I wifh I could as \\nwell anfwer the firft queftign; but w.h^t the medical virtues \\nof this fubftance may be, is a fubjedf which ftill remains ir\\\\ \\na great meafure unexplored. It is certainly well worth the \\nattention of men of fcience. To thofe who are inclined to \\nlabour in this field I take leave to fuggeft, that they ftiould \\nufe either the carbonat or fome other fait of manganefe : the \\nblack oxyde, I apprehend, muft be hardly folubie in the hu¬ \\nman fluids. \\nXIX. THE NEUTRAL SALTS. \\nThefe are the fame as of the other water, but in different \\nquantities. The gallon contains of muriat of magnefta 58; \\n—muriat of foda 330;—fulphatof fq>da 63 grains, \\nXX.

Second Memoir on the Metal contained in the Red Lead of \\n< Siberia. By Cit. Vau yi/ELlN. From the Annales de \\nChimie, Vol. XXV. 1798. \\nI HAVE already {hewn in my Aril memoir * on the \\nred lead of Siberia, that this mineral contains a parti¬ \\ncular metal, which I promifed to examine with more atten¬ \\ntion. The Council of Mines having furniflied me with a \\npretty large quantity of the red lead, confidering Its fcareity, \\n'I have been able to make a feries of experiments fufBcient \\nto determine its principal properties, of which I {hall now \\ngive an account; but it will firft be neceflary to recapitulate, \\nin a few words, the fubftance of my former memoir, in order \\nthat wliat I have to fay at p refen t may be rendered more in¬ \\ntelligible. \\n1. I {hall obferve, that on boiling the red lead reduced to \\nj |H>wder with two parts of the carbonat of potafli, the lead \\n¥■ £ \\n* See page z 79, \\ncombined \\n\", 'jSi On the life tat contained \\ncombined itfelf with the acid of the carbonat; and that \\nalkali was afterwards united with a particular acid, which \\ngave it an orange-yellow colour, and the property of produ¬ \\ncing cryftals of the fame colour, \\n2. That this new combination was decompofed by mineral \\nacids; and that on cauling the liquor, in which the decom- \\npofition had been effected, to evaporate, there was obtained, \\non the one hand, the fait formed by the mineral acid which \\nhad been added; and on the other, the acid of the red lead, \\nunder the form of elongated prifms of a ruby colour. \\n3. That the combination of the acid of the red lead with \\npotafh formed, with the nitrat of mercury, a precipitate of a \\ncinnabar red colour; with the nitrat of lead, an orange-yel¬ \\nlow fediment; with the nitrat of copper, a precipitate of a \\ncheftnut-red, &c. \\n4. That this acid alone became green by the contact of \\nlight, by a folution of tin and of the greater part of metals. \\n5. That the fame acid, either free or in a ftate of combi¬ \\nnation, combined itfelf with borax, microcofmic fait, and \\nglafs; and communicated to them a beautiful emerald-green \\ncolour. \\nSuch, in a few words, are the\" principal properties of the \\nacid of the new metal contained in the red lead, as an¬ \\nnounced in my firft memoir. I fhall now proceed to ex¬ \\namine the other chara&eriling marks of this fubffance; and \\nfhall enlarge chiefly on thofe which ought to make us con- \\n£der it as a particular metal, and on thofe which diftinguilh. \\nit from other bodies of the fame clafs. \\n* . . .. T , \\nExp. I. Action of Acids on the Red Lead. \\nIf one part of the muriatic acid, mixed with as much \\nwater, be poured over the red lead, reduced to powder, there \\nwill be formed muriat of lead, which depofits. itfelf under the \\nform of white crydals, and the liquor affumcs 3, very beauti¬ \\nful orange colour. . \\' ’ \\nIn \\n', 'In the lied Lead of Siberia, 363 \\nIn this operation the muriatic acid, as is etddent, com¬ \\nbines with it in virtue of a greater affinity to the lead, from \\n’which it feparates the natural acid, which is then diffolved in \\nthe water of the muriatic acid. When fuitable proportions \\nof the acid, water, and lead have been employed, if the liquor \\nbe evaporated by a gentle heat and without the contact of \\nlight, you may obtain cryftals of the acid of a ruby red \\ncolour. JBut if too great a quantity of the acid be ufed, \\nor an acid too much concentrated; and, above all, if heat \\nhas been employed in the procefs; inftead of a red acid \\nyou will obtain a dark green liquor, which is then a com¬ \\nbination of the oxyde of the new metal with the muri¬ \\natic acid. It will be feen hereafter what are the caufes of \\nthefe effential differences; at prefent it is fufficient to men¬ \\ntion them. \\nThe fulphuric acid decompofes alfo the red lead, by laying \\nhold of the oxyde ; but I did not employ it to extract the \\nacid, hecaufe, if ever fo little a quantity more than is necef- \\nfary be added, it is very difficult to feparate it. \\nThe nitric acid does not produce any change in the nature \\nof the red lead, only that when aided by the adtion of heat \\nit effedls its folution; but on cooling, the greater part of the \\nfed lead feparates itfelf with all its properties, \\nExp. II. Adioii of Alkalies on the Red Lead, \\nCauftic alkalies do not feem to decompofe the red lead, \\nfor they diffolve it entirely, and form with it a kind of trip!® \\ncombination ; the properties of which I did not examine \\nminutely. \\nAlkaline carbonats, on the contrary, decompofe the red \\nlead completely; and there is formed, on the one hand, \\ncarbonat of lead; and on the other, a foluble fait compofed \\nof the metallic acid and of the bafe of the carbonat em¬ \\nployed. \\nThe falts formed by this acid with alkalies cryffallife into \\nprifms, or into laminae of a golden yellow colour, the forms \\nof \\n', '^5^. On the illetal contained \\nof which I have not been able to determine accurately, o» \\naccount of the fmall quantity I could make. \\nThefe falts have a flight metallic tafce: they diffolve with \\neffervefeence, and affume a screen colour: they are decom- \\npofed by acids and alkaline earths, which form orange yellow \\nprecipitates. \\nExp. III. Action of Acids on the Acid of the Red Lead. \\nAmong the mineral acids, the muriatic 16 the only one \\n•which acts in a remarkable manner on that of the red lead. \\nIndeed, whether the red lead be diftilled, or its acid with the \\nmuriatic acid a little concentrated, there is foon difengaged \\noxygenated muriatic acid, and the liquor affumes a very \\nbeautiful green colour. The- caufe of this may be readily \\nconcerned: the muriatic acid takes from that of the lead-a \\npart of its oxygen, and reduces it to the ftate of a green \\noxyde, which is held in folution by another portion of the \\nmuriatic acid. \\nAs this experiment announced to me that the oxygen does \\nnot adhere ftrongly to that metal, I was defirous.to know \\nwhether its acid mixed with the muriatic acid would diffolve \\n■gold : I therefore put into this mixture a piece of gold leaf, \\nwhich was diflolyed in a little time by the help of a gentle \\nheat, and the folution had a yellowifh-green colour. This \\nacid then produces the fame effect as the nitric acid in aqua- \\nregia, in regard to the folution of gold. \\nThe fulphuric acid, cold, produces no effect upon this acid^ \\nhut when wanned it makes it affume a blueifh ?reen colour, \\nby favouring, no doubt, the difengagement of a portion of \\nits oxygen, as it does in regard to the oxyde of manganefe \\nand the acids of tungften and molybdena. \\nThe fulphurous acid lays hold of a part of the oxygen of \\nthis acid, becomes fulphuric acid, and reduces that of th» \\nlead to the ftate of an oxyde, which it diffolves, \\nEXfv \\n', \"in the Red Lead of Siberia; \\nEXP. IV. Reduction of the Oxyde of the Red Lead. \\nAn experiment which could not but excite my curiofity \\nwas, to know whether the acid of the red lead, treated in a \\nfuitable manner, could be reduced to a metallic {late. For \\nthis purpofe I put 72 parts of this acid, extracted by the \\nmuriatic acid in the manner before mentioned, into a cruci¬ \\nble of charcoal, which I placed in another crucible of earth \\nfilled with charcoal duft. Having then heated it for half an \\nhour in a forge fire, I found in the charcoal crucible a me¬ \\ntallic mafs of a whitifh grey colour, in the form of needles \\ninterwoven through each other, and which weighed 24 parts'. \\nThe refnlt of this operation {hews that the acid of the red \\nlead contains a large quantity of oxygen, fince of 72 parts \\nemployed, 24 only, which make one third, were converted \\ninto metal. . \\nExp, V. Properties of the Metal. \\nThe frnall malfes with which I was obliged to make mv \\nexperiments did not. allow me to difcover a great number of \\nproperties in this metal. The few, however, which I ob- . \\nferved are fufiicient to charahterife it, and to induce me to . \\nafiign it a particular place among the metallic fubfiances. \\n1. It is white, greviih, exceedingly brittle, infufible, fixed \\nand eryftallifed into needles. \\n2. Expofed to the heat of the blow-pipe it.becomes' covered’ \\nwith a lilac-coloured cruft, which, on cooling, turns green. \\n3. Heated by the fame apparatus with borax it does not' \\nmelt 3 but a part after being oXydated difiblves in that falf, \\nand communicates to it a very beautiful green colour. - \\n4. The ahlion of acids upon it is exceedingly weak. The \\nnitric acid is the only one which makes it undergo any re¬ \\nmarkable change. By diflilling five or fix times fucceffively \\nto drynefs 20 parts of this acid, concentrated, upon one of \\nthe metal, I was able to convert it into an orange yellow \\npowder, which at firft was green. \\nThisr \\n\", 'g65 On the Metal contained \\nThis powder Is acid; diffolves in water; combines itfelf \\nwith alkalies, from which it difengages the carbonic acid \\nand precipitates metallic foliations, exactly with the fame \\nphenomena as the acid of the natural red lead. It therefore \\nappears to me, beyond a doubt, that I have made here, in \\nevery refpe£l, the particular acid, fuch as it exills in the red \\nlead of which it forms one of the elements. \\nMy experiments, and the phenomena they gave rife to, as \\nmentioned in this memoir, authorife me to conlider the fub- \\nfiance which mineralifes the lead in the red lead of Siberia \\nnot only as a metal, but as a particular metal, which, with \\nthe general properties of the metals already known, poffeffes \\nvery diftindl charadterifmg marks that belong to no other* \\nWhat metallic fubllance, indeed, is there, which, converting \\nitfelf into an acid of a ruby red colour, has the property, in \\nthat ftate, of becoming green by the light, by caloric and \\nmetallic fubftances, and of precipitating the nitrate of mer¬ \\ncury of a cinnabar red colour; lead of an orange yellow \\ncolour; nitrat of copper of a cheftnut red colour; of diflolv- \\ning gold conjointly with the muriatic acid; of precipitating \\nthe tanning principle of a brown colour, and alkaline \\nprulliats green ? Without doubt there is none. \\nOn account of thefe properties, and by the advice of \\nCit. Fourcroy and Hauy, I propofe to call this metal chrome, \\nwhich fignifies colour; becaufe its combinations are, indeed, \\nall more or lefs coloured. I however mull confefs that this \\nappellation is not fuited to the metal itfelf, fince it has no \\nparticular colour; and that, befides, each metal has one \\npeculiar to itfelf, more or lefs different. I am not, there¬ \\nfore, attached to this name more than to any other that may \\nbe given it, provided it exprefs any of its molt linking and \\nmoil chara&eriftic qualities. \\nThe brittlenefs and infufibility of this metal do not give ns \\nreafon to think that it can be applied to very many ufeful \\npurpofes; but we may Hill hope that, if it can be found \\nhereafter in larger quantities, the combinations of its acid \\n-? 1 o with \\n', \"in the Red Lead of 'Siberia. \\nWith metallic oxydes, and of its oxyde with vitreous fub- \\nilances, will furnith very beautiful and durable colours for \\nthe art of painting and enamelling. This hope appears to \\nme fo much better founded, as I have already difcovered the \\noxyde of this metal in the emerald, in which it forms the \\ncolouring principle. I have alfo found it in the matrix of \\nthe red lead, in the ftate of a green oxyde combined with \\nthe lead; and I have no doubt that it may be found in \\nmany other combinations, when minerals {hall be examined \\nwith more care than they have hitherto been. \\nIt relults then that chrome is a peculiar metal before un¬ \\nknown; that this metal, infufible and cryflailifable, has little \\naffinity with oxygen, from which it derives however two \\nthirds of its weight; that this acid of a red colour diffolvcs \\nin water and combines with alkalies, earths and metals, to \\nwhich it communicates different colours, but more or lefs \\nanalogous to its own; that it readily lofes a part of its oxygen \\neither by light, caloric, or the contadl of certain metals, and \\nthe greater part of combuftible fubflances, by palling through \\nall thefe circumftances to the Hate of a green oxyde; and \\nhence it is that this acid and all its combinations yield, by \\nheat, a certain quantity of oxygen, and communicate to glafs \\na beautiful green colour. \\nVI. Fropofalfor a new Hygrometer. By Mr. H.0CHHE1MER. \\nFrom Economifche Hefte. \\nVa RIO iJ S hygrometers have been invented, but they \\nare all in feme degree imperfedt: ill, becaufe they do not \\ndetermine with accuracy in what proportion water isdiffolved \\nin the atmofphere; and 2dly, becaufe they do not fuffer the \\nmoifture they have imbibed to efcape from them in the fame \\nproportion as that in which they attra&ed it. I {hall, there¬ \\nfore, mention in a brief manner only a few’ of them, and then \\npropofe a new method of conftrudling a hygrometer; though \\nI tnuft, at the fame time, remark, that I by no means offer \\nit \\n\", \"n ^ # l1 f i i.4- i \\n%68 Tropofal for a neiu Hygrometer* \\nit as a. pefflA and complete inftrument. I wifh merely fc \\ncommunicate my ideas on the fubjeft, and to give others an \\nopportunity of examining it farther, and of perhaps pro¬ \\nducing forhething that may be better calculated to anfwer the \\nintended purpofe. It is, indeed, much to be wifned, that an \\naccurate hygrometer could be invented; as it may be readily^ \\nconceived that fuch an inftrument would be of the utmoft uti¬ \\nlity, not only to naturalifts, butalfo to farmers and others. \\n■ c \\nThe moft common hygrometer, known under the name of \\na weather-houfe, is founded on the property of feveral twifted \\nfubftances to untwift themfelves in a moift atmofphere, and \\nthen to twift themfelves back when the weather is dry. The \\nfubftances chiefly employed are cat-gut; and, when required \\non a largefcal'c, hempen ropes. Caflebois, aBenediftine manky \\nat Metz, propofed another hygrometer, which confifts of the \\ngut of a ftlk-worm. When that infledt is ready to fpin, there \\nare found in it two vefleis proceeding from the head to the \\nftomach, to which they adhere, and then bend towards the \\nback, where they form a great many folds.- The part of thefe \\nvefleis next the ftomach is of a cyfindric form, and about a \\nfine in diameter. Thefe vefleis contain a gummy fort of \\nmatter from which the worm fpiris its fllk; and, though \\n■t > \\nthey are exceedingly tender, means have been devifed to ex¬ \\ntract. them from the ihfcft, and to prepare there for the above \\npurpofe. When the worm is about to fpin, it is thrown in¬ \\nto vinegar, and fuffered to remain there twenty-four hours; \\nduring which tiihe the vinegar is abforbed into the body of \\nthe infect, and coagulates its juices. The worm- being then \\nopened, both the vefleis, which have now acquired ftrength,; \\nare extracted; and, on account of their pliability* are ca¬ \\npable of conftderable extenfion. That they may not, how¬ \\never, become too weak, thev are ftretched onlv to the lenatli \\n. •> J C \\nof about fifteen or twenty inches. It is obvious that they \\nfnuft be kept fufficiently extended till they are completely \\ndry. Before they attain to that ftate they muft be freed, by \\nmeans of the noil of the linger, from a flimy fubftance which \\nadhered \\n\", \"Vropofalfor a new 'Hygrometer. %6g \\nadheres to them. Such a thread will fuftatn a weight of fix \\npounds without breaking; and may be ufed for an hygro¬ \\nmeter ill the fame manner as cat-gut* Paper, parchment, \\nwood, ivory, hair, and the beard of wild oats, &sc. have \\nbeen employed for hygrometers on the fame principle. \\nAnother fort of hygrometer is founded on the increafe of \\nweight Which certain bodies acquire by the moifture they \\nattract from the atmofphere. Thus, for example, if a fponge \\nwhich has been dipped in a folution of fal ammoniac, and \\nagain dried, be fufperided in the open air at the end of a ba¬ \\nlance, the variation- of its gravity marked by a weight placed \\nat the other-end will fhew the temperature of the atmofphere \\nin regard to drought and moifture. \\nMr. Lowitz found at Dmitriewfsk in Aftracan, on the banks \\nof the Wolga, a thin blueifh kind of ft ate which attracted \\nmoifture remarkably foon, but again fuftered it as foon to \\nefcape. A plate of this date weighed, when brought to a red \\nheat, 175 grains, and, when faturated with water, 247: it \\nhad therefore imbibed, between complete drynefs and the \\npoint of complete moifture, 72 grains of water. Lowitz fuf- \\npended a round thin plate of this date at the end of a very \\ndelicate balance, faftened within a wooden frame, and fuf- \\npended at the other arm a chain of diver wire, the end of \\nwhich was made faft to a hiding nut that moved up and \\ndown in a fmall groove on the edge of one fide of the frame. \\nHe determined, by trial, the pofttion of the nut when the \\nbalance was in equilibrio and when it had ten degrees of \\nover-Weight, and divided the fpace between thefe two points \\ninto ten equal parts, adding fuch a number more of thefe \\nparts as might be neceftary. When the ftone was fufpended \\nfrom the one arm of the balance, and at the other a weight \\nequal to 175 grains, or the weight of the ftone when per¬ \\nfectly dry, the nut in the groove ftiewed the excefs of weight \\nin grains when it and the chain were fo adjufted that the \\nbalance ftood in equilibrio. A particular apparatus on the \\nfame principles as £ vernier, applied to the nut, {hewed the \\nVol, L Bb excefs \\n\", '<*i rv \\nJ/ u \\nProp ofal for a new Hygrometer.• \\nexcels of weight to ten parts of a grain. Lowitz remarked \\nthat this hygrometer in continued wet weather gave a moift \\nture of more than 55 grains^ and in a continued heat of 113 \\ndegrees of Fahrenheit only i t degree of moifture. \\nIn my opinion, it would not be neceffary, in order to con- \\nflmet fuch a hygrometer, to procure argillaceous date from \\nAftracan, as feveral other argillaceous kinds of Hate,, as well \\nas hones and other lubffances, poffels m an equal degree tjie \\nfame property. If a perfon, for example, preflea with the \\nfinger on a marble flab, a grey free-ftone or a piece of glafs, \\nit will immediately attract the infenflhle perfpiration, and \\nbecome tarniflied. \\nThe hygrometer thus invented by Lowitz was however \\nattended with this fault, that it never threw off the moifture \\nin the fame degree as the atmofphere became drier. It was \\nalfo fometimes very deceitful, and announced moifture when \\nn ought to have indicated that drynefs had again begun to \\ntake place 111 the atmofphere. fto avoid thefe mconvemencies, \\nI would propofe the following method 1 \\n1. Take a fquare bar of heel about two lines in thicknefs, \\nand from ten to twelve inches in length, and form it into a \\nkind of balance, one arm of which ends in a ft raw. On this \\nferew let there be fcrewed a leaden bullet of a proper weight, \\ninftead of the common weights that are fufpended. \\n2. I ake a glais plate about ten inches long and feven inches \\nin breadth, deftroy its polifli on both fides, free it from aft \\nmoifture by rubbing it over with warm aflies, fufpend it at \\nthe other end of the balance, and bring the balance into equi¬ \\nlibrium by ft re wing up or down the leaden bullet. \\n3. Mark now the place to which the leaden bullet is brouo-ht \\nto \\nby the ferew, as accurately as pofiible, for the point of tire \\ngreateft. drynefs. \\n4* I hen take away the glafs-plate from the balance, dip \\nit completely in water, give it a fhake that the drops may \\nrun oft from it, and wipe them carefully from the edge. \\n/ \\n5- APP]y \\n', \"'Propofalfor a new Hygrometer. 3 71 \\n3.

Method employed in Spain for making the Alcarrazas, \\nor Veffels ufed there for cooling Water. By Cit. Las TETRI £• \\nFrom the Journal des Mines, No. XXXIV\\\\ 1798. \\nA LCARRAZAS are a kind of veffels ufed in Spain for \\ncooling water intended for drinking. As they are exceed¬ \\ningly porous, the water oozes through them on' all fides; \\nthe air which comes in contadt with it, by making it evapo¬ \\nrate, carries off the caloric contained in the water in the \\nvellel, and by thefe means renders it remarkably coolf. \\nI f Thefe \\n* We would recommend a glafs cafe. Edit. \\n. + It is a principle, ur.iverfally admitted, that a liquid, palling to a \\nftate of vapour, appropriates to itfelf a quantity of caloric, which it takes \\nfrom thofe bodies with which it is in contact. The more volatile a liquid \\nthe more rapid will be this effeft; and it is on this principle that che- \\nB b 2 mitts, \\n\", \"372 Method-employed in Spain \\nThefe vefTels, which are of different forms and £zesy are \\nmanufactured in various parts of Spain, and are generally of \\na greyifh white colour. The mod celebrated place for this \\nfpecies of pottery, and that from which all the veffels of this \\nkind ufed at Madrid are brought, is- Anduxar in Andaiufia. \\nThe earth employed for making them is procured on the \\nbanks of a rivulet called Tamuforo, which is fituated at the \\ndiftance of a quarter of a league from the above town. \\nThe ufe of thefe vafes was introduced into Spain by the \\nArabs. They are ftill ufed in Egypt, as well as in different \\nparts of Africa; and are known in the Eail Indies, Syria, \\nPerfia, China, and other parts of Afia. \\n. It is aftonifhing that thefe vafes were never introduced by \\nthe Arabs into Sicily. I never faw any of them in any \\npart of that id and. This lingular faCt proves, that the \\nfimpleff and moft beneficial ufages are rarely imitated by \\nfnifts, during the heats of fummer, caufe, in home minutes, the congela¬ \\ntion of water inclofeci in a filial! glafs ball covered with a .cloth dipped in \\nether, care being taken to renew it in proportion as it evaporates. It is \\nwell known that coldnefs may be c fib died by liquors much Iefs volatile \\nthan ether, either by expofing the vale, the furface of which has been \\nmoiftened with them, to a current of air, or by Twinging it round a point of \\nfnfpenfron, which by moving it through the air ferves to favour the folu* \\ntion of the vapour in the. atmofphere. From thefe principles it will be \\nreadily conceived on what depends the property of the alcarrazas-above \\nmentioned. On being expofed to the open air, or rather to a current of \\nair, the water they contain becomes cool in a little time, and to fuch a \\nfenfible degree, that in fummer, when the thermometer hood at 991 0 F. \\ntti the iha.de, at Madrid, the water has been known to delcend to the \\ntemperature of water preferred a confidcrable time in a cellar. Thefe \\nvafes, however, cannot be long ufed, unlefscarc be taken to fill them only \\nwith, very pure water, and fuch as is little charged with the fulphat of \\nlime ( j'dante). 1 urbid water foon clofes up the pores even of filtering' \\npaper; and the lame efft-dt will be produced by water that holds infolution \\nlulphat of lime, becaule the water abandons it in proportion as it unices \\nwith the air in a ftate of vapour. To open the pores, clofed up by earthy \\nfalts, it will be fufficient to keep thefe vafes for Tome moments in boiling \\nwater. Edit, \\nother \\n\", \"for making the Alcarrazas. 373 \\nOther nations, unlefs recommended by fome favourable in¬ \\ncident. \\nThough France is fo near to Spain, and though there has \\nalways been great intercourfe between thefe two countries, \\nno traveller has ever yet given an account of the procefs em¬ \\nployed in the fabrication of the above vafes. The introduc¬ \\ntion of them into France would, in my opinion, be attended \\nwith great advantage; for, betides the pleafure of drinking \\ncool water during the great heats, we ought to take into \\nconlideration the benefit that would arife from them in \\nregard to the health. I have, therefore, procured correCt \\ninformation refpeCting the manner in which thefe vafes are \\nmade in Spain; and I have brought alcarrazas to France, as \\nwell as the earth employed in the fabrication of them. \\nCit. Darcet was dehrous of analyfing this white marly \\nearth ; and, by employing all the precifion neceffary for that \\npurpofe, he found that 100 grains of it contained 60 of cal¬ \\ncareous earth mixed with alumine and a little oxyd of iron \\ndifficult to be diffolved, and 36^ of filiceous earth alfo \\nmixed with alumine and the fame oxyd The quantity \\nof iron may be eftimated at alrnofl a grain. The procefs for \\nfabricating the alcarrazas is very fimple; and, as the earth \\nemployed abounds in France, it will be eafy, by the method \\nwhich I fliall explain, to eftablifh manufactories of this \\nkind; the expences of which will be trifling, and the profits \\ncertain, if the public do not refufe to adopt a ufeful practice. \\nThe preparation given to the earth may be reduced to \\nthree principal operations, \\nI ft Preparation. Suppofe it were neceffary to manufac¬ \\nture 150 pounds of earth: after it has been dried, and divided \\ninto portions of the fize of a walnut, it is macerated in a \\nbaton or tub, by proceeding in the following iuanncr: The \\n/ \\n* A French journal flares the refult of Cit. Dareet’s analyfis thus: \\n•4‘ About one third part of calcareous earth ; one third alumine; one third \\nJex—mixed \\\\ykh a very fmall portion of iron.’' Edit. \\nworkman \\n\", '374 Method employed in Spain \\nworkman takes three or four celemins of earth which are \\nfpreaci out equally in the bafon, and water is poured over it; \\nhe then throws in three or four celemins more of earth, \\nwhich are watered as before; and this operation is repeated \\nuntil the tub be fufficiently full. In pouring on the 1 aft \\nwater, care is taken not to add more than may be necelfary \\nto cover the whole mafs. The earth is buffered to remain in \\nthis hate for twelve hours; after which it is worked and \\nkneaded with the hands, in the tub, until it is reduced to. \\nthe conMence of a tough pafte. The earth is then de- \\npofited on a fmooth platform covered with brick, kept ex¬ \\nceedingly clean, and over which is ftrewed a little fifted \\nafhes. It is formed into a cake about fix inches in thicknefs, \\nwhich is fmoothed on the furface as well as at the tides. It is \\nleft in that hate until it begins to crack; after which it is \\nfreed from the allies adhering to it, and removed to another \\ntiled place made exceedingly clean. \\n2d Preparation. To this earth the workman adds feven \\npounds of lea fait, if he withes to make j arras y and only the \\nhalf if it is defined for the fabrication of hotifas or cantaros. \\nj hi3 difference^ arnes from the greater or lefs capacity in¬ \\ntended to be given to the vafes, The larger the vafe is. Its \\ntides mutt: be to much thicker, in order that it may have the \\nnecelfary degree of ffrength; but the earth, at the fame \\ntime, muft be more porous, otherwife the water would not \\nfilter through with eafe; and, for this reafon, the workman \\nadds a greater quantity of fait when he wifhes to make \\njarraSy which are much larger than the hotifas and cantarose \\n4 he earth is kneaded with the feet, adding the fait gradually; \\nand this labour is repeated, at leaft three times, without the \\nnecelfity of adding more water, as the moifture retained by \\nthe earth is fufficient. \\nPreparation. Ihe earth, after being fubjedted to thefe \\ndifferent preparations, is fit to be applied to the lath. The \\nThe celcmin is a meafure of capacity, which contains about feven \\npounds of grain* \\n', 'for making the Alcarrazas. 375 \\nman who is employed for this work ought to knead it well \\nwith his hands, taking\\' care to extract the hones, even the \\nfmalleft which he may meet with, as well as every other \\nforeign body. He then forms it into lumps, which he ap¬ \\nplies to the lath to be made into vafes or jars. \\nThe alcarrazas may be baked in any kind of furnace ufed \\nby potters. Thofe employed in Spain are eighteen feet \\nfquare in the infidej and five feet three inches in height. \\nThe flame enters by a hole, one foot four inches in diameter, \\njituated in the centre. Such a furnace will contain 800 \\npieces of different flzes, including 500 jarras. Pottery of \\nmuch greater ftrength than the alcarrazas may be baked in \\nthe fame furnace, if care be taken to keep up the fire for one \\nor two hours longer. The alcarrazas, which require to be \\nonly half b.aked, remain there ten or twelve hours, according \\nto the temperature of the air, or the greater or lefs quantity \\nof fuel employed. \\nPrecedes different from that which I have here defcribed, \\nare purfued in fome of the potteries in Spain; but they all \\ndepend on the fame principles. After the earth has been \\npounded, it is differed to macerate in a tub for twenty-four \\nhours; the whole is ftirred round with a flick, and it is \\nfreed from the ftraws or other foreign bodies that float 011 \\nthe furface. The ftones and coarier parts of the earth fall to \\nthe bottom of the veffel, and the finer is drawn off by a hole \\nfour inches above it. The earth is then left to dry to a certain \\ndegree requifite; and it is afterwards depofited in a moift \\nplace, to be employed as may be found neceflary. In other \\nmanufactories, the earth, when dry, is ground below a roller; \\nafter which it is lifted, and, the proper quantity of fait and \\nwater being added, it is then kneaded. The proportion of \\nhalt is not every where the fame. In fome places the fame \\nquantity of earth requires a half lefs of fait. Care is always \\ntaken to choofe earth of a proper quality, without ever \\n\"having occafion to add to it\\'a mixture of fand. The fame \\n£arth is employed alfo for common pottery; the only dif- \\nB b 4 ference \\n', \"376 Theory of Cryjlallifation. \\nference is, that fait is added to the clay ufed for the alcarrazas, \\nand that they are only half baked. \\nThere is not a Angle family in Madrid where thefe veffels \\nare not ufed. They are filled with water, which is expofed \\nfor feveral hours to a current of air, in order that the evapo¬ \\nration may be more rapid, and that the water confequently \\nmay become cooler. \\nA kind of red veflels called bucaros, employed likewife to \\ncool water, are made alfo at a place called Salvatierra in \\nEftramadura; but the earth being lefs porous, it is not fo \\nproper for the intended purpofe. Befides, thefe vafes com¬ \\nmunicate to the water a difagreeable argillaceous tafte. \\nThey are, however, in great requeft among the ladies of \\nMadrid ; fome of whom pound fragments of them, and mix \\nthe powder with fnuff. Young girls have a particular fond- \\nnefs for this kind of pottery, and eat it when they are \\nt \\ntroubled with the phlorofis. \\nVafes of a fimilar kind to thofe above defcribed, are em- \\nployed in Portugal for moiftening fnuff. They are plunged \\ninto water, after being filled with this article; and the \\nwater which filters infenfibly through them communicates \\nto it, at the end pf fome hours, the neceffary degree of \\nhumidity. \\nVIII.

Forms of the integral Molecule. \\nThe primitive form is that obtained by fe&ions made on \\nall the fimilar parts of the fecondary cryftal; and thefe fec- \\ntions, continued parallel to themfelves, conduc'd to a determi¬ \\nnation of the form of the integral molecul sc, of which the \\nwhole cryftal is an affembiage. This requires certain con- \\nfiderations that relate to the mqft delicate point of the theory, \\nwhich I fhall now explain, with as much precifion as the \\nnarrow limits to which I am obliged to confine myfelf will \\n• allow. • \\nThere \\n\", \"Theory of Cry fa Ufa tioiu \\nThere is no cryftal from which a, nucleus in the form of a \\nparallelopipedon may not be extracted, if we confine our- \\nfelves to fix lections parallel two and two. In a multitude \\nof fubftances this parallelopipedon is the laft term of the \\nmechanical divifion, and confequently the real nucleus. \\nBut there are certain minerals where this parallelopipedon is \\ndivilible, as well as the reft of the cryftal, by farther fections \\nmade in the different directions of the faces; and there \\nthence neceflarily refults a new folid, which will be the \\nnucleus, if all the parts of the feeondary cryftal, fuper- \\nadded to this nucleus, are fimilarly fituated. When the * \\nmechanical divifion conducts to a parallelopipedon, divifible \\nonly by feCtions parallel to its fix faces, the moleculae are \\nparallelopipedons fimilar to the nucleus; but, in all other \\ncafes, their form differs from that of the nucleus. This f \\nfliall iiluftrate by an example. \\nLet acbsno (fig. 60.) be a cube, having two of its folid \\nangles. ay s, fituated on the fame vertical line. This line will \\nbe the axis of the cube; and the points a and s will be its \\nfummits. Suppofe this cube to be divifible by fedions, each \\nof which, fuch as a hn, paffes through one of the fummits \\na.) and by two oblique diagonals ah, an, contiguous to this \\nfummit. This fedtion will detach the folid angle i; and as \\nthere are fix folid angles, fituated laterally, viz. i, h, c, r, o, n, \\nthe fix fedHons will produce an acute rhomboid, the fummits \\nof which will be confounded with thofe of the cube. Figure \\n61 reprefents this rhomboid exifting in the cube, in fuch a \\nmanner that its fix lateral folid angles k, d,fy p, g, e, cor- \\nrefpond to the middle of the faces a chi, cr s h, h i n s, &c, \\nof the cube. But geometry {hews that each of the angles^ \\nat the fummits bag, dsfi psf, &c. of the acute rhom¬ \\nboid, are equal to 6o°, from which it follows that the lateral \\nangles abfi agfi &c. are equal to 120 degrees, \\nBefides, it is proved by theory, that the cube refults from \\na decrement which takes place by a fmgle range of fmalj \\n.

This decrement pro¬ \\nduces two faces, one on each tide of each of thefe ridges, which \\nmakes in all twelve faces. But as the two faces, which have \\nthe fame ridge for their line of departure, are on the fame \\nplane by the nature of the decrement, the twelve faces will \\nbe reduced to fix, which are fquares; fo that the fecondary \\nfolid is a cube. This refult is analogous to that of the very \\nobtufe calcareous fpar before mentioned. \\nLet us now fuppofe that the cube (fg. 60.) admits, in \\nregard to its fummits a, s, two new divifions fimilar to the \\npreceding fix, that is to fay, one of which pafles through \\nthe points c, 1, 0, and the other through the points h, n, r. \\nThe firft will pafs alfo through the points b, g, e, and the \\nfecond through the points d,f p, (_fig. 61 and 62.) of the \\nrhomboid; from which it follows, that thefe two divifions \\nwill detach each a regular tetraedron bage or dsfp (fg. 62.), \\nfo that the rhomboid will be found converted into a regular \\noctaedron e f (fg. 63.), which will be the real nucleus of \\nthe cube; finec it is produced by divifions fimilarly made, \\nin regard to the eight folid angles of the cube. N \\nIf we fuppofe the fame cube to be divifible, throughout its \\nwhole extent, by fedtions analogous to the preceding, it is \\nclear that each of the fmall rhomboids of which it is the af- \\nfemblage, will be found, in like manner, fubdivided into an \\nqdtaedron, with two regular tetraedra applied on the two op¬ \\nposite faces of the qdtaedron, \\nBy taking the odtaedrQn for nucleus, we may conftrucf \\naround this nucleus a cube by regular fubtradtions of fmall \\ncomplete rhomboids. Fojf example, if we fuppofe decre¬ \\nments by a fingle range of thefe rhomboids, having b for \\ntheir point of departure, and made in a direction parallel to \\nthe inferior edges gf eg, dc, df of the four triangles, \\nwhich unite to form the folid angle d, there wall refult four \\nfaces, which will be found on a level, and, like the odtaedron, \\nfVgh fix folid angles, fimilar decrements around the other \\nfive- \\n', '3 So Theory of Cryfiallifation* \\nlive angles will produce twenty faces, which, taken four \\nand four, will be equally on a level, which will make, in \\nthe whole, fix diftindl faces, fituated as thofe of the cube \\n(fig* 6o.); fo that the refult will be precisely the fame as in \\nthe cafe of the rhomboid considered as nucleus. \\nIn whatever manner we proceed to fubdivide either the \\ncube, the rhombus, or the odtaedron, we Shall alwa* s have \\nfolids of two forms, that is to fay, odtaedra and tetraedra, \\nwithout ever being able to reduce the refult of the divifion to \\nunity. But the moleculas of a cryftal being necefiarily firm- \\niar, it appeared to me probable that the ftrudture was as it \\nwere interfperfed with a multitude of fmall vacuities, occu¬ \\npied either by the water of cryftallifation or by fome other \\nfubftance; fo that, if it were poffible to carry the divifion to \\nits limits, one of the two kinds of folids in queftion would \\ndifappear, and the whole cryftal would be found compofed \\nonly of molecvdae of the other form. \\nThis idea is the more admiffible, as each octaedron being \\nenveloped by eight tetraedra, and each tetr^edron being \\nequally enveloped by four octaedra, whichever of the forms \\nwe imagine to be fupprefied, the folids that remain will join , \\nexactly by their edges ; fo that, in this refpedt, there will be \\ncontinuity and uniformity throughout the whole extent of \\nthe mafs. The manner in which each oolaedron is enve¬ \\nloped by eight tetraedra may be readily conceived, if we take \\ncare that in dividing tfie cube (fig. 60.) only by the fix fee- \\ntions given by the rhombus, we may depart at pleafure from \\nany two, a} s; o, h $ c, n; 2, r, of the eight folid angles, \\nprovided that thefe two angles be oppofite to each other. But \\nif we depart from the angles a, sy the rhomboid will have \\nthe pofition {hewn fig. 6%.

It is thence feen, \\nthat whatever may be the two folid angles of the cube af- \\nfumed for the points of departure, we fhall always have the \\nlame oCtaedron, with two tetraedra contiguous by their fum- \\nmits to the two folid angles in queftion; and as there are \\neight of thefe folid angles, the central oCtaedron will be cir- \\neumferibed by eight tetraedra, which will reft on its faces. \\nThe fame effect will take place if we continue the divifton \\nalways parallel to the firft feCtions. Each face of the oc- \\ntaedron, then, however fmall we may fuppofe that odlaedron \\nto be, adheres to a face of the tetraedron, and reciprocally. \\nEach tetraedron then is enveloped by four oCtaedra. \\nThe ftruCture I have here explained is that of fparry fluor. \\nBy dividing a cube of this fubftance we may, at pleafure, ex¬ \\ntract rhomboids, having the angles formed by their planes \\nequal to 130^ or regular oCtaedra, or tetraedra, equally re¬ \\ngular. There are a fmall number of other fub.ftances, fuch \\nas rock cryftal carbonate of lead (fparry lead), &c. which \\nbeing mechanically divided beyond the term at which we \\nIhould have a rhomboid or parallelopipedon, give alfo parts \\nof various different forms aftorted together in a manner even \\nmore complex than in fparry fluor.

On the other hand, there \\nare fubftances, which, being divided in all poflible directions, \\nrefolve themfelves only into tetraedra. Of this number are \\ngarnet, blend, and tourmaline.

Difference between Structure and Increment, \\nIn what I have hitherto faid refpe&ing the decrements tQ \\nwhich the laminae of fuperpolition are fubjeCted, my only \\nview was to unfold the laws of ftru&ure ; and I am far from \\nbelieving that, in the formation of a dodecaedral cryftal, or \\none of any other form having a cube for nucleus, .the cryf- \\ntallifation has originally produced that nucleus fuch as it is \\nextracted from the dodecaedron, and made it afterwards pafs \\nto the figure of that dodecaedron, by the fucceffive appli¬ \\ncation of all the laminae of fuperpofition by which it is co¬ \\nveted. On the contrary, it feems proved, that from the firft \\nmoment the cryftal is already a very fmall dodecaedron, con¬ \\ntaining a cubical nucleus proportioned to its fmall fize, and \\nthat the cryftal afterwards increafes by degrees without \\nchanging its form, by new layers which envelop it on all \\nfides, fo that the nucleus increafes alfo, always preferring \\n|he fame relation with the whole dodecaedron* \\n', \"Let us make this more ftriking by an example taken from \\na plane figure.

On \\n', 'E 393 3 \\nIX. On the Principles of Equilibrium, and the Stability of \\nfoating Bodies applied to River and Canal Boats of dif¬ \\nferent Forms. By Mr. John G ot.ge English, Teacher \\nof Mathematics and Mechanical Philofophy. Communicated \\nby the Author. \\n.v v A ■ *. s . ’ / \\nThe principles of dynamics -in general, and of ftatics in \\nparticular, have already been fo fully explained by fome of \\nthe ablelt mathematicians in Europe, that little or nothing \\nof confequence is farther to be expelled on thofe fubjedts, \\nunlefs our mode of calculus be either greatly improved or \\ntotally changed. And as neither of thefe events is likely \\nfoon to take place, we ought certainly, in the mean time, to \\napply to the common concerns of life the principles pf which \\nwe are already in pofleffion. But fmee war and merchandife \\nfeem at prefent to be the chief bulinefs of all European \\nnations, and lince neither the one nor the other can be \\ncarried on to any great extent without navigation, nor can \\nany veiTel with fafety be navigated without a proper degree \\nof liability; it is therefore a matter of the greatell im¬ \\nportance to determine with accuracy the liability of \\nnautical veflels of all kinds. \\nHowever operofe and difficult the neceffary calculations \\nmay in fome cafes become before the degree of this effential \\nquality can be obtained, yet they all depend upon the four \\nfollowing fimple and obvious theorems, accompanied with \\nother well known llereometrical and ftatical principles. \\nTheorem I. Every floating body dilp-laces a quantity of \\nthe fluid in which it floats, equal to its own weight: and \\nconfequently, the fpecific gravity of the fluid will be to that \\nof the floating body, as the magnitude of the whole is to \\nthat of the part immerfed. \\nTheorem II. Every floating body is impelled downward \\nby its own eflfential power, adding in the direction of a \\nvertical line palling through the centre of gravity of the \\nwhole, \\n', '394 Mode of calculating the \\nwhole* and is impelled upward by the re-a&ion of the \\nfluid which fupports it, a&ing in the direction of a vertical \\nline palling through the centre of gravity of the part im- \\nmerfed : therefore, unlefs thefe two lines are coincident, the \\nfloating body thus impelled muft revolve round an axis, \\neither in motion or at reft, until the equilibrium is reftored. \\nTheorem III. If by any power whatever a veffel be \\ndeflected from an upright pofition, the perpendicular diftance \\nbetween two vertical lines palling through the centres of \\ngravity of the whole, and of the part immerfed refpe&ively, \\nwill be as the liability of the veffel, and which will be pofitive, \\nnothing, or negative, according as the metacentre is above, \\ncoincident with, or below, the centre of gravity of the veffel. \\nTheorem IV. The common centre of gravity of any \\nfyftem of bodies being given in pofition, if any one of \\nthefe bodies be moved from one part of the fyftem to \\nanother, the correfponding motion of the common centre of \\ngravity, eftimated in any given direction, will be to that of \\nthe aforefaid body, eftimated in the fame dire&ion, as the \\nweight of the body moved is to that of the whole fyftem. \\nFrom whence it is evident, that in order to afcertain the \\nliability of any veffel, the pofition of the centres of gravity of \\nthe whole, and of the part immerfed muft be determined; with \\nwhich, and the dimenfions of the veffel, the line of floatation, \\nand angle of deflection, the liability or power either to right \\nitfelf or overturn may be found. \\nIn flops of war and merchandife, the calculations necef- \\nfary for this purpofe become unavoidably very operofe and \\ntroublefome; but they may be much facilitated by the experi¬ \\nmental method pointed out in the New Tranfa&ions of the \\nSwedilh Academy of Sciences, firft quarter of the year 1787, \\npage 48. \\nIn river and canal boats, the regularity and fimplicity of \\nthe form of the veffel itfelf, together with the compact dif- \\npofition and homc-geneal quality of the burden, render that \\nmethod for them unnecefiary, and make the requifite calem, \\n', \"Stability of River and Canal Boats, \\nfations become very eafy. Veflels of this kind are generally \\nof the fame tranfverfe fedtion throughout their whole length* \\nexcept a fmall part in prow and ftern, formed by fegments \\nof circles or other Ample curves; therefore a length may \\neaiily be afligned fuch, that any of the tranfverfe fedtions \\nbeing multiplied thereby, the product will be equal to the \\nwhole' folidity of the veflel. The form of the fedtion \\nAB CD is for the moft part either rectangular as in fg. i. \\n{Plate XIII.), trapezoidal as in fg. %. or mixtilineal as in \\nfg. 3. in all which MM reprefents^ the line of floatation \\ni * \\nwhen upright, and EF that when inclined at any angle \\nM X E; alfo G reprefents the centre of gravity of the whole \\nveflel, and R that of the part imnierfed. \\nIf the veflel be loaded quite up to the line AB, and the \\nfpecific gravity of the boat and burden be the fame, then the \\npoint G is Amply the centre of gravity of the fedtion ABCD; \\nbut if not, the centres of gravity of the boat and burden \\nmuft be found feparately, and reduced to one by the com¬ \\nmon method, namely, by dividing the fum of the momenta \\nby the fum of weights, or areas, which in this cafe are as \\nthe weights. The point R is always the centre of gravity \\nof the fedfion MM CD, which, if confifting of different \\nfigures, muft alfo be found by dividing the fum of the \\nmomenta by the fum of the weights as common. Thefe \\nfwo points being found, the next thing neceflary is to de^ \\ntermine the area of the two equal triangles MXE, MXP, \\ntheir centres of gravity 0, 0, and the perpendicular projedted \\ndiftance n n of thefe points on the water line E F. This \\nbeing done, through R and parallel to E F draw R T — a \\nfourth proportional to the whole area M M C D, either \\ntriangle MXE or MXF, and the diftance n n\\\\ through \\nT, and at right angles to R T or E F, draw T S meeting \\nthe vertical axis of the veflel in S the metacentre; alfo \\nthrough the points G, B, and parallel to S T, draw N G W \\nand BV; moreover through S, and parallel to EF, draw \\nW S V meeting the two former in V and W; then S W is \\n\", \"Made of calculating t%e \\nas the liability of the velfel, which will be pofitive, nothing;, \\nor negative^, according as the point S is above, coincident \\nwith, or below, the point G. If now we fuppofe W to re~ \\nprefent the weight of the whole velfel and burden (which \\nwill be equal to the fedlion MMCD multiplied by the \\nlength of the velfel), and P to reprelent the required weight \\napplied at the gunwale B to futlain the velfel at the given \\nangle of inclination; we fhall always have this proportion: \\nas VS : S W :: W : P; which proportion is general, \\n-whether S W be pofitive or negative; it muft only in the \\nlatter cafe be fuppofed to ad upward to prevent an overturn. \\nIn the rectangular velfel, of given weight and dimenlions, \\nthe whole procefs is fo evident, that any farther explanation \\nwould be unnecelfary. In the trapezoidal velfel, after \\nhaving found the points G and R, let AD, BC be pro¬ \\nduced until they meet in K. Then lince the two fed ions \\nMMCD, EFDC are equal, the two triangles MMK, \\nEFK are alio equal; and therefore the redangie E K X \\nJCF — KMxKM^KM1; and lince the angle of incli¬ \\nnation is fuppofed to be known, the angles at E and F are \\ngiven. Confequently, if a mean proportional be found \\nbetween the lines of the angles at E and F, wre fhall have \\nthe following proportions: \\nAs the mean proportional thus found: line Z.E :: KM : KF, \\nAnd as the faid mean proportional: line Z_F :: KM : KE; \\ntherefore ME, MF become known; from whence the area \\nof either triangle MXE or MXF, the diftance /zzz, and \\nall the other requilites may be found. \\nIn the mixtilineal fedion, let AB = 9 feet = 108 inches, \\nthe whole depth = 6 feet — 72 inches, and the altitude of \\nM M the line of floatation 4 feet or 48 inches; alfo let the \\ntwo curvilinear parts be circular quadrants of 2 feet, or 24 \\ninches r&dius each. Then the area of the two quadrants = \\n904'7 808 fquare inches, and the diftance of their centres of \\ngravity from the bottom = 13-8177 inches very nearly; alfo \\nthe \\n\", \"Stability of River and Canal Boats. 397 \\nthe area of the included redtangle able— 1440 fquare \\ninches, and the altitude of its centre of gravity 12 inches; \\nin like manner the area of the redtangle A B c d will be \\nfound = 5184 fquare inches, and the altitude of its centre \\nof gravity 48 inches; therefore we {hall have \\nMomentum of the % quadrants = 904*7808 X 13*8177 =2 12501*9896601$ \\nMomentum ofthere£tan.able =1440- X is — 17280* \\nMomentumof the re«5tan.ABo/=5184* X 48 =248832* \\n7528*7808 ' 2 7 8613 *9896601.6 \\nNow the fum of the momenta divided by the fum of the \\nareas will give 98_9^oi5 _ qo6 inches the aj. \\n& 7528*7808 \\ntitude of G the centre of gravity of the fection A B C D \\nabove the bottom. In like manner the altitude of R the \\ncentre of gravity of the iedtion MM CD will be found to \\nbe equa! = 24.934 inches. and corfe. \\nquently their difference,' or the value of G R = 12*072 \\ninches, will be found. \\nSuppofe the veffel to heel 15? and we fliall have the fol¬ \\nlowing proportion, namely, As radius : tangent of 15 : * MX \\n' - 54 inches : 14*469 inches = ME or MF ; and confe- \\nquently the area of eitner triangle MXE or MXF ■ \\n390*663 fquare inches. Therefore, by theorem 4th, As \\n4936*7808 : 390*663 : : 72 ~ nn =- f AB : 5*^976 inches \\n— RT 5 and again, As radius : fine of 15° ' • 12*072 — GR 1 \\n3*1245 inches = RN ; confequently RT—RN =,5*6975**^ \\n3*1245.= 2*573 inches = SW the ftabihty required. \\nMoreover, As the fine of 15° : radius : : 5’^975 ~ BTs \\n22*013 =RS, to which if we add 24*934? the altitude of \\nthe point R, we lhall have 46*947 i°r ^ho height of the \\nmetacentre, which taken from 72^ the whoie altitude, there \\nremains 25*053 ? from which and the half width = 54 \\ninches, the diftance BS is found = 59’5^9 inches very \\nm nearly. \\n\", 'Method of purifying MotaffeL \\nnearly, and the angle SBV = 8o° — o6/—\\\\,x1\\'; from whence \\nSV - 58*645 inches. \\nAgain : Let us fuppofe the mean length of the veflel to be \\n40 feet, or 480 inches, and we fliall have the weight of the \\nwhole veflel equal to the area of the fedion M M CD = \\n4936*7808 multiplied by 480 0369654*784 cubic inches \\nOf water, which weighs -exadly 85708 pounds avoirdu- \\npoife, allowing the cubic foot to weigh 60*5 pounds. \\nAnd, finally, as SV : SW (z. eh) as 58*645 r 0*573 •• \\n85708 : 376q {-, the weight on the gunwale which will \\nfuftain the veffel at the given inclination.

From Journal de 1’Ecok \\nPolytechnique, Vo l, II. 6th Year. \\nHEN SanHorius invented his balance, he taught \\nus what we lofe by infenfibie perfpiration; and no one, \\nwithout this difeovery, would perhaps ever have imagined \\nthat the matter thrown out from the body is more than half \\nwhat we receive as nourifhment. Knowledge no lefs im¬ \\nportant might be acquired, had we the eafy means of afeer¬ \\ntaining, in a comparative manner, our relative ffrengths at \\nthe different periods of life, and in different ftates of health, \\nBuffon and Gueneau, who had fome excellent ideas on this \\nfubjedf, requefted me to endeavour to invent a portable ma¬ \\nchine, which, by an eafy and Ample mechanifm, might \\nconduhf to a folution of this quefdon, on which they were \\nthen engaged. Thefe philofophers were acquainted with that \\ninvented by Graham, and improved by Dr. Defaguliers, at \\nLondon; but this machine, conftruHed of wooden-work. \\nWas too bulky and heavy to be portable ; and, befides, to \\ntnake experiments oa the different parts of the body, feveral \\nmachines \\n', '400 Description and Ufe \\n0 \\nmachines were necefiary, each fuitcd to the part required ter \\nbe tried. They were acquainted alfo with the dynanometer \\nof Cit. Leroy of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. It \\nconfifted of a metal tube ten or twelve inches in length, \\nplaced vertically on a foot like that of a candleftick, and \\ncontaining in the infide a fpiral fpring, having above it a \\ngraduated thank terminating in a globe. This thank, toge¬ \\nther with the fpring, funk into the tube in proportion to \\nthe weight acting upon it, and thus pointed out, in degrees, \\nthe ftrength of the perfon who prefled on the ball with his \\nhand. \\nThis inftrument, though ingenious, did not appear fuffi- \\ncient however to Buffon and Gueneau; for they wifhed not \\nmerely to afeertain the mufcular force of a finger or hand, \\nbut to eftimate that of each limb feparately, and of all the \\nparts of the body. I fhall not here give an account of the \\nattempts I made to fulfil the wifties of thefe two philo- \\nfophers, but only obferve, that in the courfe of my experi¬ \\nments I had reafon to be convinced that the ccnftrudtion of \\nthe inftrument was not fo eafy as might have been expected. \\nBetides the ufe w hich an enlightened natural iff may m ake \\nof this machine, it may be poiTiblc to apply it to many \\nother important purpofes. For example, it may be em¬ \\nployed with advantage to determine the ftrength of draught \\ncattle ; and, above all, to try that of horfes, and com¬ \\npare it with the ftrength of other animals. It may ferve \\nto make known how far the affiftance of well-conftrucf:- \\ned wheels may favour the movement of a carriage, and \\nwhat is its vis inertia in proportion to the load. We might \\nappreciate by it, alfo, what reftftance the dope of a moun¬ \\ntain oppofes to a carriage, and be able to judge whether a \\ncarriage is fufficiently loaded in proportion to the number \\nof horfes that are to be yoked to it. In the arts, it may be \\napplied to machines of which we wiili to afeertain the re- \\nliftance, and when we are defirous to calculate the moving \\nforce that ought to be adapted to them, It may ferve, alfo, \\nai \\n', \"bf the Dy nanometer* 40X \\nt,,' * j * \\nk$ a Homan balance to weigh burdens. In Ihort, nothing \\nwould be more eafy than to convert it into an anemometer^ \\nto difcover the abfolute force of the wind, by fitting to it a \\nframe of a determined fize filled up with wax-cloth; and \\nit would not be impoffible to afcertain by this machine the \\nrecoil of fire-amiSj and confequently the ftrength of gun¬ \\npowder. \\\\ \\nThis dynanometer, in its form and lize, has a near refem- \\nblance to a common graphometer.

Each of thefe \\narcs is ftill farther divided by points, which exprefs the \\ntveight in pounds de marc\\\\ and all thefe degrees having \\nbeen exadtly valued by accurate weights, it thence refults^ \\nthat all dynanometers of this kind may be compared with \\neach other, ' \\nVot.

The whole \\nof this mechanifm is fcen of its full fize at H. \\nF, a heel index, very light and elaftic, fixed upon its axis \\nby a fcrew in the centre of the brals femicircle. This index \\nhas a fmall bit of leather or cloth glued upon the fmall cir¬ \\ncular part G, in order to render the fri&ion on the plate \\neafy, uniform, and almoft infenfible. It is to be obferved, \\nthat this index is terminated by a double point, adapted to \\nthe divifions on both the femicircular arcs. The firft, di¬ \\nvided into myriogrammes and points, expreffing ten pounds \\nde marc, ferves for all experiments which oblige the fpring \\nto be elongated in the direction of its greater axis, as is the \\ncafe in trying the ftrength of the reins; in a word, for all \\ntrials where it is neceffary to draw the fpring by the two \\nends.

This regulus is then \\ncoarfely pounded, and, with a folution of fal ammoniac, \\nformed into a pafte, which is rubbed into the engraving on \\nfilver plate. The filver is then wiped clean, and fuffered to \\nbecome fo hot under the muffle, that the fubftanGe rubbed \\ninto the firokes of the engrkving melts and adheres to the \\nmetal. The filver is afterwards wetted with the folution of \\nfal ammoniac, and again placed under the muffle till it \\nbecomes red hot.

After this \\nmanner a large bath was decorated in a cafino of the king of \\nNaples at Belvidere near Caferta, the walls and vaulted \\ncieling of which were entirely covered with encaufto, under \\nthe direction of Mr. Hackert, who was fo obliging as to \\naccompany Mr. Tatham to vifit the fuccefs of it, which he \\n■* \\ndid, much to his fatisfadfion, when upon his travels in the \\nyear 1795. \\nThe firft preparation is as follows : Infufe a pound of gum \\ntragacanth * in a proportionate quantity of water, for twen¬ \\nty-four hours, in an earthen vefiel. When this folution is \\npretty thick, add to it mineral colours of any fort, broke \\ninto pieces without being pounded, and which muft afterr \\nwards be prepared in the following manner ; \\nPut an ounce of white wax and an ounce of gum \\ntragacanth into a fmall earthen vefiel well glazed, toger \\nther with two or three pounds of water, and keep the vef- \\nfel over a brifk fire, that the ingredients may become lb \\nquid, ftirring them continually with a fmall flick. When \\nthe whole are well difiblved, take the vefiel from the fire, \\nand, after the liquor has cooled, fkim off the wax from \\nthe furface.

From Annales de Chimie, Vol. XXVI. \\nTHE epidermis of the human fkin is perhaps the belt \\nexpanded and the eafieft to be detached of any, and for that \\nreafon I made it the fubjed qf the following experiments. \\nThe human (kin becomes Ihrivelled in hot water, and \\ndivides itfelf into two diftind parts, the epidermis and the \\ncutis. The latter refembles then in its confidence a foftened \\ncartilage. The continued adion of warm water at length \\ndiflolves the cutis, but does not fenfibly affed the epidermis. \\nAlcohol kept a long time in digeftion on the epidermis \\nhkewife produces no effed. Cauflic alkali diflolves it, and \\nthe fame effed is produced by lime, though more {lowly. \\nThere is then an analogy between the external covenng of \\nthe human body and that which covers fllk. From thefe \\nohfervations we are authonfed to deduce the following con- \\nfequences, which may he applied, without overftraining the \\nprinciple, to the operations of tanning. 1. If we plunge \\ninto a tanning infufion a piece of fkin covered by its epi¬ \\ndermis, the tan penetrates only on the flefh-fide : the other \\nfide is fecured from it by the epidermis, which is not fulcep- \\ntible of any combination with the tanning principle. \\n2. When the epidermis is removed by the operation of \\nliming, the tan then penetrates on both {ides of the fkin. \\n3. Lime, which is generally employed for taking off the \\nhair, feems to ad only by diflblving the epidermis. Lime- \\nwater has more adion than undiffblved lime; but its effed \\nceafes the moment that the {mall quantity of lime held in \\nfolution is combined with the epidermis : hence the necef- \\nfity of renewing the lime-water till the whole effed required \\nJ>e produced,, XV. qj \\n', \"t 4io .] \\nXV.

By M. D. J4NSENS of \\nOoflerhout. From the New Tranfadtions of th6 Imperial \\nAcademy of Sciences at Peterfhurgh, Vol. I. \\nOoiterhout, Nov, 23d, 1778, \\nIN the converfation I had the honour of having with your \\nExcellency on the medical virtue of carbonic acid gas, or fixed \\nair, I promifed to give you an account of the-effects it might \\nproduce in the putrid fever, by being injedted into the rec¬ \\ntum ; but though in the following cafe, which is certainly \\nvery uncommon, I have not exactly followed the method \\npointed out by your Excellency, having been obliged to give \\nas much of the cinchona or Peruvian bark as poffible, [ \\nhowever believe that it greatly contributed to the cure. \\nThe wife of a bargeman at G. Berg, named N. Swart, \\naged thirty-two, of a fangume temperament and a found \\nconftitution from the time of her birth, was attacked, after \\nher third natural delivery, according to every appearance a \\nfavourable one, which happened on the 6th of Odlober at \\ntwo o'clock in the morning, with a fever that began on the \\n8th. It may be right to premife, that on the 6th fhe was \\nexceedingly well, and her evacuations were perfectly free. \\nOn the ^th they flowed lefs, and fhe began to complain \\nof laffitude, a great heaviness in all her limbs attended with \\na lofs of appetite, and the difappearance of milk from her \\nbreaks. At the commencement of the third day the eva¬ \\ncuations were flopped, and the fever came on by cold and \\nfucceffive fits of fhivering with reaching and pain in the \\nhead, which was not acute, but accompanied with a fenfa* \\ntion like that of a weight prefling on the cranium, and frora \\nwhich flie fuffered lefs when in bed than when fitting up. \\nThefe fymptoms were followed by a great heat, with vomit¬ \\ning of a bilious, greenifli; highly corrupted fluff; her tongue \\n.W34 \\n\", '-A Cure by Carbonic Acid, Gas. 41 * \\nwas covered with a vifcous matter of a yellowifh colour the \\ntwo fir ft days, but it was afterwards brown till the 6th. \\nHer breathing was fhort, oppreflive, and accompanied \\nwith a fetid fmell. The pulfe, which was weak, beat from \\n90 to 94 in a minute. The heat was not examined by \\na thermometer. The urine was red and fetid, without \\nfediment. The patient had a violent thirft, and drank a \\ngreat deal of whey with lemon juice. \\nOn the fecond day of the fever fhe was affedted with \\n.delirium, coma, reftleffnefs, and a dread of death. On \\nthe third all thefe fymptoms increafed. On the fourth \\nthere was an involuntary difcharge of urine, &c. On \\nthe fifth there came on a diarrhoea of a bilious and pu- \\ntrid matter; and the delirium being then continual, fhe fuf- \\nfered every thing to efcape her. On the ftxth the fymptoms \\nwere no better. On the feventh the tonfils were white, and \\nthis thickened fecretion, at length, covered all the parts of. \\nthe mouth; deglutition became difficult, there was fubfultus \\ntendirium, and the patient with her trembling fingers picked \\nthe blankets. Qn the eighth all the fymptoms were as be¬ \\nfore, with vibices half an inch in diameter, which rofe in \\nfmall blifters, and appeared on the breaft, the hands, and \\nOther parts of the body. On the ninth thefe blifters dif- \\neharged blood, for the moft part thin and corrupted, the \\nground of which was in fome a brown purple, and in others \\nred. The cheeks were alfo of a brown purple colour, the \\neyes hollow, and the,pupils much dilated. At laft a cold \\nfweat broke out on the face, the hands and feet; the mouth \\nquivered, and the cheeks, lips, and all the members of the \\nbody were {lightly convulfed. \\nAll thefe bad fymptoms gave reafon to be apprehenfive \\nfor the life of the patient; but the pulfe continuing regu¬ \\nlar gave me fome hope. While the patient was in this \\ncondition, beino- called in to confult with the phyfician who \\nhad treated the cafe according to the rules of the art, I ad- \\nyifed the application of carbonic acid gas by the redtum, to¬ \\ngether \\n', '4J2 A (Sire by Carbonic Acid Gas, \\ngether with the following decoction: Twenty-five grains of \\nfait of tartar (carbonat of potafh) diffolved in five ounces \\nof a ftrong deco&ion of bark, I gave five ounces of this \\ndeco&iori, in which I had put as many drops of fpirit of \\nvitriol (fulphuric acid), to extricate the fixed air. \\nThis inje&ion was given twice the two firfl days, and \\nonly once daily for the three following. \\nIn regard to medicine, the patient took every hour, in a \\ncup-full of tea, the following deco&ion : Cinchona or bark \\nin a coarfe powder, four ounces, digefted in a fuffieient \\nquantity of common water for three hours, till reduced to \\ntwo pounds.

On the four¬ \\nteenth a perfect crifis took place in regard to the urine and \\nperfpiration. On the fifteenth the patient felt no more \\nfever, and had no fymptom of difeafe except great debility; \\nlo that on the twentieth day fhe was perfectly re-eftablifhed. \\nDuring the courfe of the difeafe her breafts were flaccid \\n?nd very fmall, without milk; but having viflted her on the \\n* This does not appear to be the belt method that might have been \\ndeviled for introducing the carbonic acid gas.

Extract of a Memoir on the Eoffil Bones of Qua- \\ndrupeds. By Cit. Cuvier. From Bulletin des Sciences, \\nJVo. XVIIL \\nTH E author’s object In this memoir was to collect, as \\nfar as pofiible* every information refpeCting the various \\nkinds of foffil bones hitherto found* whether feen by him- \\nfelf or defcribed by others; to examine the fkeletons, and \\nto compare them with thofe of animals now exifting on the \\nglobe* in order to determine how far they are fimilar or \\ndifferent. The following are the kinds which he examined : \\nI. The bones and tufks called by the Ruffians the bones \\nand horns of the mammoth. Such foflil remains are \\nfound in various parts of Europe. This animal is a kind \\nof elephant nearly refembling that of Alia* but differs from \\nit in the alveoli of its tulks being longer 5 that the angle \\nformed by its lower jaw is more obtufe* and that the la¬ \\nminae of which its grinders are compofed are thinner. A \\nliving animal really analogous to it is not known, though it \\nhas hitherto been confidered as a common elephant. \\n3. The \\n', '414 Oft FoJJil Bones of Quadrupeds. \\n2. The remains of an animal which have been found dr£ \\nthe banks of the Ohio in North America, and which the \\nAmericans and the Englifh confider as thofe of the mam¬ \\nmoth alfo, though this animal is very different from the \\npreceding. Remains of it are found alfo in Europe and Alia* \\nIt muff be almoll of the fame height as the elephant, \\nbut more bulky. Its tulks are fmaller ; its grinders are \\narmed with large cutting points, the feftion of which pre- \\nfents, when they are worn down, double tranfverfal lo¬ \\nzenges. There are three grinders on each fide; one of \\nwhich has four points, the fecond fix, and the other eighth \\n3. The animal, the teeth of which tinged by copper \\nfurnifh the turquois. Of thefe foffils there was a mine at \\nSinore in Languedoc. Remains of the fame kind are \\nfound in the department of Ain, in Peru, and other places. \\nThis animal mull have refembled the preceding; but the \\npoints of its grinders are of a conical form, and, when \\nworn down, their fedtion prefents, firff a circle, then a \\nfemi-oval, and then the figure of a trefoil; which has made \\nthem be confounded with the teeth of the hippopotamus*. \\nSome of thefe teeth have twelve points, others fix, and \\nothers four. \\n4. The hippopotamus. There are found in France, and \\nother countries, teeth and the fragments of jaw bones, in \\nwhich the author has never yet been able to difcovcr any \\nthing different from thofe of the common hippopotami. As \\nhe never faw, however, a whole bone, he cannot affirm the \\nidentity. \\n5. That fpecies of rhinoceros with an elongated cranium, \\nthe bones of which are found in Siberia, Germany, and \\nother countries. The author has feen teeth and portions \\nof the jaws found in France, which appeared to him to be¬ \\nlong to this animal. The principal charadlerifing mark of \\nthis fpecies confills in the offeous partition of the nofe. A \\nliving animal analogous to it is unknown*. \\n6. A \\n', \"On the Foffil Bones of Quadrupeds* 41^ \\n6. A grinder with two tranfverfal eminences, in the pof- \\nfeffion of Cit. Gillet, and of which a germ is preferred in \\nthe National Mufeum. It has no refemblance to the teeth, \\nnor to the germs of the teeth, of any animal, whether living \\nor in a foffil ftal,e, hitherto known. The only teeth to \\nwhich it bears a refemblance is the laft lower grinder of \\nthe rhinoceros. This tooth indicates, then, the exiftence \\nof a lixth foffil fpecies analogous to no living animal \\nknown. \\n7. The animal, twelve feet in length and fix in height \\nthe ikeleton of which was found below the earth in Para¬ \\nguay, and is now preferred in the Cabinet of Natural Hif- \\ntory belonging to the king or Spain at Madrid. By a mi¬ \\nnute companion of the bones of this fkeleton with thofe of \\nall the known quadrupeds, the author proves that it is a pe¬ \\nculiar and diftindt ipecies, which approaches nearer to the \\nfloth than to any other kind, and that it might be named \\nthe giant-floth. Cit. Cuvier here mentions, occaiionally, \\nan interefting difcovery he has made, that the a ', or three¬ \\ntoed floth (bradypus tridaBylus, Lin.) has naturally and \\ninvariably nine cervical vertebrae. This is the firft known \\nexception to the rule eftabliflied by C. Daubenton, that all \\nthe viviparous quadrupeds have neither more nor lefs than \\nfeven cervical vertebrae. \\n8. The animal, remains of which are found in the ca¬ \\nverns near Gaylenreuth and Muggendorf, in the margraviate \\nof Bayreuth in Franconia. Several have confidered this \\nanimal as a fea-bear; but it differs from it, as well as from \\nall the bears known, in the form of its head, charadterifed \\nabove all by the projection of the forehead ; the want of \\nthe fmall tooth, which the bears hitherto known have be¬ \\nhind each canine tooth ; by the cifcous canal of the hume¬ \\nrus, through which the tracheal artery pafles; and by \\nfeveral other circumftances in the figure and proportion of \\nthe bones. It is however to the bear that this animal has \\nthe greatefl: affinity. \\n9. The carnivorous animal, bones of which are found in \\n6 the \\n\", \"t)n the FoJJit Bones of Quadrupeds. \\nthe plader done of Montmartre. The form of its jaw¬ \\nbones* the number of its grinders, the paints with which \\nthey are armed, indicate that this fpecies muft belong to the \\ngenus of the canis. It howeveEdoes not exactly refemble any \\nknown fpecies of that genus. The mod; driking didin<dive \\nmark is, that the feventh lower grinder is the greated in \\nthe animal of Montmartre; whereas it is the fifth in the \\ndog, 'wolf, fox, &c. \\n10. The animal, a lower jaw of which, found near Ve¬ \\nrona, has been contidered by Jofeph Monti as a portion of \\nthe cranium of the fea-cow; an opinion adopted by all \\ngeologids, though contrary to the fimpled principles of com¬ \\nparative anatomy. This jaw, according to Cit. Cuvier, has \\nbelonged to an animal approaching near to the mammoth, \\nthe animal of the Ohio, and that of Sinore, though Ipeci- \\nfically different. Its mod particular chara&erifmg mark \\nconfids in the beak formed by its fymphyfis. \\n11. The animal of the dag kind, bones and horns of \\nwhich are found in Ireland, England, at Maedricht, See.- \\nIt is evidently didin£t from all the dags known, and even \\nfrom the elk, to which it has been referred, on account of \\nthe enormous fize of its horns, the flatnefs of the upper \\npart of them, and the branches that arife. from the root. \\nSeveral figures of them may be feen in the Philofophicai \\nTranfa&ions. \\n12. The genus of the ox alone furnifhes feveral fpecies of \\nfoffils. The fkulls of two which have been deferibed by \\nPallas, were found in Siberia. One of thefe he referred to \\nthe common buffalo; but he afterwards referred it to a par¬ \\nticular fpecies named arni, originating from Thibet. Cd. \\nCuvier proves, by odeological comparifon, that this fkull \\ndoes not belong to the buffalo. The other kind appeared to \\nPallas to belong to the buffalo of the Cape, or the mufk- \\nox of Canada. Cit. Cuvier fhews that they could not have \\nbelonged to the former; but, not having the cranium of \\nthe arni nor the mufk-ox, he does not fpeak with certainty \\nof their identity or non-identity with thefe foflil crania. \\nThe. \\n\", 'On Atmofpheric Air* 417 \\n*fhe author defcribes, ajfo, two forts of crania found in the \\ninodes in the department of La Somme, and which have a \\ngreat refemblance to thofe of the urus, which are nearly one \\nfourth larger. \\nCit.

It is \\nHot agreeable to truth to affert that the animals of the fouth \\n.have formerly exifted in the north, their fpecies not being \\nperfectly identic. 2. That there have exifted in all coun¬ \\ntries animals which do -not exift at prefent, and that are no \\nwhere to be found in any known part of the globe.

Obfervations on the ConJlitUent Parts of Atmofpheric \\nAir. By Count de MoRQZZO. With the, Rejjiarks of \\nF. Van Hu mb OL r. From the Journal de Phyfique, \\nFruhiidor, 6th Year. \\nIn the memoir which I publifhed in. 1784^ on animal \\nrefpiration in dephlogifticated or oxygen gas, I offered fome \\nrefledlions refpedting the conftituent parts of atmofpheric \\nair, founded on experiments I had made. Lavoifter, in his \\nElementary Treatife of Chemiftry, does not agree with my \\nexperiments. That author fays, that the component parts \\nof atmofpheric air are 73 parts of mephitic or azotic gas, and \\n37 of oxygen gas, eminently refpirable. It will then be \\nfeen, adds he, that when animal fubftances are diffolved in \\nthe nitric acid, there is difengaged a great quantity of gas, \\nwhich extinguifties a lighted candle, injures animals, and \\nWhich has a perfedl refemblance to that part of atmofpheric \\nair which is unfit for refpiration. If to 73 parts of this fluid \\nWe add 27 of oxygen gas, obtained from mercury reduced \\nto the ftate of an oxyde by calcination, there is formed a \\nVox,, I, Ee \" fluid \\n', '418 On the Conjlituent Parts \\nfluid perfe&ly fimilar to that of the atmofphere, and winch \\nhas all its properties. \\nThe following, on the other hand, are the corollaries \\nwhich I have deduced from a great number of experiments \\nmade to afcertain the duration of animal life in noxious \\naeriform fluids, mixed in different proportions with oxygen \\ngas, tending to illuftrate the real compofition of atmofpherid \\nair. * \\nX. The examination by means of burning tapers is not \\naccurate for afcertaining the falubrity of the air. I {hall \\nquote only two examples. A fifth part of oxygen gas \\nmixed with air contaminated by the vapour of fulphur, \\nfuffered a candle to burn, while an animal {hut up in it \\ndied in a few feconds. A feventh part of the fame gas \\nmixed with air vitiated by the vapour of charcoal, fupported \\nflame, while an animal died in it almoft inftantaneoufly. \\n2. That pure and falutary part faid to be contained in at¬ \\nmofpheric air, which forms a third of it according to \\nScheele, and a fourth according to Lavoifier, is not a real \\ndephlogifticated oxygen gas ; fince this gas united with \\nmephitic airs, in a much lefs proportion than a third or \\nfourth, fupports the flame of a candle after an animal dies \\nin it, which is not the cafe with atmofpheric air. * \\n3. The real component parts of atmofpheric air are flil! \\nunknown; fince, with a mixture of different gafes, no¬ \\nthing has been obtained but compound gafes, which have, \\nindeed fome properties of air, but never thofe of atmo¬ \\nfpheric air. \\nThe author, to illuftrate the queftion, relates eight cha- \\nra&erifing marks of atmofpheric air, acknowledged by phi- \\nlofophers; and adds, that though he tried, by a multitude \\nof experiments, to compofe atmofpheric air, by mixing de¬ \\nphlogifticated gas with different mephitic gafes, the gafes \\nfo obtained always contained fomething not to be found \\nm atmofpheric air. \\nH* \\n', 'of Atmofpheric Alt. • 419 \\nHe repeated the experiments of Lavoifier, by mixing 73 \\nparts of fixed air (carbonic acid gas), obtained from lime, \\nwith 27 of gas obtained from the red precipitate. This \\nmixture, indeed, exhibited to him all the characters and \\nproperties of atmofpheric air, but it differed confiderably \\nfrom it in its effential property. \\nA candle is fuddenly extinguished in atmofpheric air in \\nwhich an animal has died; another animal could not live in \\nit an inftant. On the other hand, in this artificial mixture, \\na flame burnt with vivacity; and a fecond animal, a fpar~ \\nrow, lived 25 minutes, a third 14 or 15 a light, introduced \\nafter the death of the third fparrow, burnt Still with a bright \\nflame. 6i This mixture then does not form an elafic fluid \\nferfedly fimilar to that of atmofpheric air, and having all \\nits properties ” He tried to add to this mixture phlogifti- \\ncated gas, inflammable air, and that in which an animal \\nhad died. A fecond and third animal lived in them fome \\ntime, and a candle was not extinguished. \\nRemarks on the above Ohfervations, by F. Von Humbolt. \\nThe memoir of Count Morozzo treats of a very important \\nfubjecS, with which I have been engaged for fome months, \\nihe Italian philofopher has obferved the difference between \\nnatural atmofpheric air and an artificial compound of azot \\nand oxigen; but, in my opinion, he goes too far, in affert- \\nmg that atmofpheric oxygen is not vital gas; though I agree \\nwith him that we are not able to form an aeriform fluid, \\nfueh as the illuftrious Lavoifier announces in his Elements \\nt \\nof Chemiftry, perfectly fimilar to that of the atmofphere. \\nI however find that this difficulty confifts neither in our \\nignorance of the quantity, nor of the quality of the two \\ngafeous bafes. The difference found between the effeCt of \\nnatural and artificial atmofpheric air, is to be afcribed to the \\njiate of the combination in which the oxygen is joined to the \\nazot. The atmofphere is not a mixture: its conftituent \\nparts ought to be confldered as in a ftate of chemical combi- \\nEe5( . nation« \\n', 'On the Cmftituent Tarts, &6. \\nnation* It is for this reafon that the two bafes of a fpeciiic \\ngravity fo different, that of azot and that of oxygen, do not \\nentirely (Separate from each other, though the high regions \\nare mod charged with azot. Hence azot retains fo ftrongly \\nthe laft portion of the oxygen, which phofphorus, the ful- \\nphure of potafh, and other acidiliable bafes ought to take \\nfrom it; and I have for this reafon feen that the nitrous gas \\nadts in proportions very different in decompofing the natural \\natmofpheric air, or a compound of 27 of oxygen and 73 \\nazot. But how could Morozzo think to imitate the atmo- \\nfphere by mixing the carbonic acid and oxygen ? He has \\nconfounded azot with the carbonic acid gas. But he allures \\nus that his atmofpheric air with a carbonic acid bafe, gave \\nthe fame fpecific weight as atmofpheric air. Here is a \\nvery ftriking experiment: one cubic inch of azot weighing \\n0,46624 grains, while the dime cubic inch of carbonic \\nacid weighed 0,67300 grains ! Morozzo tells us that a \\ncandle burnt in his artificial mixture with a very brilliant \\nflame (conjiamma lucidijjlma). By combining 0,25 of the \\ncarbonic acid with 0,75 of oxygen, I have feen a wax taper \\nextinguifhed. The fame thing took place when in com¬ \\npany with Taffeart in Vauquelin’s laboratory, I mixed two \\nparts of the carbonic acid gas with ten parts of atmofpheric \\nair. There is then formed a new chemical combination: \\nthe carbonic acid lays hold fo Arongly of the oxygen of the \\natmofphere, that the affinity prefented by the lighted wax \\ntaper is not powerful enough to take it away. In my \\n•work on the analyfls of the mephitic vapour of mines, \\nwhich is about to he tranflated into French, it will be feen \\nthat there exiits airs not unfit for refpiration, which are com- \\npofed of 0,27 of oxygen, o,;o of azot, and 0,03 of carbonic \\nacid gas. It is the ftate of the combination, and not always the \\nquantity of oxygen, which renders air more or lefs capable to \\ndeftroy animal life, or to extinguifh flame, \\n-• ■ \\nXVIII.

Some, \\nwith the fchool of Epicurus, think that this fluid is a conti¬ \\nnual emanation of the luminous body which throws to a \\ndiftance a portion of its fubftance. This is what is called \\nthe emiflion of light, and was the opinion adopted by \\nNewton. \\nOthers., among whom is Euler, think that the luminous \\nfluid is diftufed throughout infinite fpace, and that it is aCted \\nupon by the luminous bodies as the air is by fonorous bo¬ \\ndies. This opinion appears to Cit. de la Metherie much \\nfnore probable than the former. \\nOne of the ftrongeft objections made to this opinion is, that \\nlight is never propagated but in a ftraight line. Objects cannot \\nbe feen, except when no opake body is interpofed between \\nthem and the eye, whereas founds are heard in every kind \\nof direction. Euler replied to this, by faying, that bodies are \\npermeable to founds. Befides there are cireumftances where \\nfounds alfo cannot be propagated but in a right line; for \\nexample, in echoes which are heard only in a very fmall \\nfpace. \\nChemifts likewife are divided in their opinions refpeCting \\nthe luminous fluid. Some believe it to be an elementary \\nfubftance, and others have confounded it with fire. Richter \\nbelieves that it is compofed of the inflammable principle and \\ncaloric. \\nBenedict Prevoft has endeavoured to eftimate the gravity \\n©f the luminous fluid. He made to float on water very thin \\nround plates of tin, and thefe bodies were repelled when a \\ncylinder of red hot iron was prefented to them obliquely at \\nIqme diftance, or when the rays of the fun collected into a \\nE e 3 focus \\n', '422 Curfory View offome of the late Difcoveries in Science, \\nfocus by a lens were made to fall upon them. Prevoft is of \\nopinion that the rays of the fun penetrating the tin-plate are \\nthus combined with a matter more denfe, and form therein \\na very e^panfible fluid; but being lefs fubtle, it becomes fufi? \\nceptible of adding by impulsion on very large m aides, and \\nitfuing with impetuofity from the plate, but more rapidly \\nfrom the focus, pufhes it backwards, and purfues its way \\nthrough the water, which adds as a conduddor to this fluid. \\nThe author conjectures, from thefe experiments, that it is \\npoflible to deterrmine the gravity of light. It is well known \\nthat it takes about eight feconds to come from the fun to the \\nearth, that is to fay, to traverfe a fpace of about thirty-three \\ntrillions of leagues. According to fome fuppofltions, he finds \\nthat the light which in a fecond of time falls upon the fur- \\nface of a fquare league, containing 2,283 toifes on each fide, \\nwould weigh about a dram (gros) and a quarter. It may be \\nreadily perceived that all thefe calculations are very hypothe¬ \\ntical ; and we may add, that from fome .experiments made \\nby Profeftor Wilfon of Glafgow*-, with a view to a different \\nobjedd, there,i-s rcafon for calling in queftion the efledt pro¬ \\nduced upon the thin plates, or tin foil, as being at all pro¬ \\nduced by the impulfe of light. Heat only feems to be here \\nconcerned. The water at firft being of an uniform tempera¬ \\nture, has all its parts in a ftate of equilibrium and reft. \\nWhen the tin foil is heated, it is evident that a very addive \\ncaufe is introduced tending to deftroy that equilibrium. Pleat \\nbeing communicated by the tin to the water in contadd with \\n% that portion of the water endeavouring by its expanfion to \\nmove from under the tin, mu ft tend to move the tin from its \\nplace. \\n[T o be continued.] \\ngee the Profeffor’s experiments on fmall lighted wicks floating on oil, \\njnfeitcd in the Edinburgh Tranladtioiv), Voi.

In which of the known parts of vegetable productions, \\nthe bark (cortex), inner bark {liber), wood (alburnum et \\nlignum), pith (medulla), does the fap afcend? Does a reflux \\nof the fap towards the root, proportioned to the afcent, take \\nplace in the bark or the pith, or in both ? And, if this be \\nthe cafe, by what way is it conveyed from the interior parts \\nto the bark ? W hat courfe does it, in particular, take to pafs \\nthrough the leaves to the bark ? \\n1 he Academy willies, in particular, that the motion of \\nthe fap in the bark upwards may be proved or refuted; both \\nby a careful repetition, varying the eircum{lances, of the ex¬ \\nperiments which have already been adduced as a proof of it, \\nand by a fufficient number of well chofen and appropriate \\nnew experiments. ri he belt founded experiments, which \\nprove the alcent of fap in plants, have been enumerated by \\nDuhamel, in Phyjique des Arbres, b. v, chap, a, art. 7—ji, \\n6 and’ \\n', 'Prize QueJIhn, 425 \\nand the moft important of them are as follows: I. If a \\nplant is fuffered to imbibe a coloured fluid, it afcends in the \\nveflels between the pith and the bark, penetrates to the \\nleaves, and then proceeds through the bark a certain fpace \\ndownwards. 2. When a plant or a twig is comprefled at \\nthe bottom by a ligature, a fwelling takes place upwards \\ntowards the ligature. 3. When the bark of a tree is taken \\noff, without injuring the interior part, the upper edge of the \\nwound produces a greater quantity of pioifture than the \\nunder. 4. Under thefe circumftances an excrefcence is \\nformed 011 the upper part of the bark, and not on the \\nunder; and the renovation of the inner bark, which has \\nbeen loft, takes place from the top downwards. \\nII. What beneficial ufe may practical medicine derive \\nfrom Humboldt’s well known experiments on Galvanifm and \\nmetallic irritation ? \\nThe Academy expe&s that the difeafes and cafes, in \\nwhich Galvanifm may be ufeful, will be accurately deter- \\nmined by proper experiments; and that the experiments \\nwill be clearly and fully defcribed.

But this is not precifely \\nthe cafe. Several veins appear indeed to be of that form ; \\nbut there are many others, the form of which is quite the \\nreverie. Humboldt fays that the vein of Kuhchacht at \\nFreyberg, which contains argentiferous galena, grows \\nbroader, inftead of becoming narrower, the deeper it goes 5 \\nand yet it is one of the deeped: worked, as it proceeds to \\nthe depth of feveral hundreds of fathoms.

'427 \\nlays, lie lias feen th s air, thus compreffed, produce a very \\ngreat degree of cold when the cocks were opened to buffer \\nit to efcape. To demonftrate this in an eafy manner, let a \\nfinal] quantity of water be put into a compreffing machine. \\nWhen the air efcapes, it ififues with a hiding noife, and \\ncarries with it a part of the water; and at the end of the \\noperation, the water adhering to the cock, will be found \\nconverted into ice. To explain this phenomenon, we may \\nfuppofe that a portion of the water, which is carried off by \\nthe air, is reduced to an aeriform date, or that of vapour* \\nBut this could not be the cafe, unlefs a pretty conhderable \\nquantity of caloric were combined with the vapour. The \\nremaining drops of water are therefore fufficiently deprived \\nof it to be congealed. It is in the fame manner that the \\nrapid evaporation of ether, applied to the ball of a thermo-* \\nmeter, makes the liquor fpeedily defcend fcv.eral degrees. \\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\nDr. Soemmering has proved, by a great number of obfer-> \\nvations, that the degree of intelligence of different animals \\nis always in proportion to the bulk of the brain, compared \\nwith that of the nerves. Man has the moft voluminous \\nbrain, and his nerves are very fmall: it is this which gives \\nhim his high degree of intelligence. The afs has v’ery large \\nnerves, and a verv fmall brain. Dr. Ebel has publifhed on \\nthis fubjeft a very interefting differtation, which we hope \\nfoon to be able to lay before our readers, \\nGRAVITY OF WATER, \\nBodies are dilated by warmth, and confequently become \\nSpecifically lighter the hotter they are. On the contrary, \\nfhey are contra&ed by cold, and become fo much denfer the \\ncolder they are. But this law of conclenfation is fubjedf to \\nfome exceptions: melted metal, for example, dilates to a \\n.eertair) degree as it becomes folid -? water experiences the \\nfame \\n\", \"4-28 i Meteorology» \\nfame dilatation in congealing. To find then the greateff \\nfpecific gravity of water, we ought not to take ice, for we \\nknow that it fwims on water. We mud make choice of a \\ncertain degree of heat between that of congelation and that \\nof expanfion. Experience has determined this point to be \\nabout 410 of Fahrenheit. Confequentiy, to find the greateft \\nquantity of water which can be contained in a veflel of a \\ngiven capacity, we mud take water at that temperature. \\nThis circumftance fhould be attended to in determining \\nmeafures of capacity. Some people are fo well aware of it \\nthat they buy liquids in cold, and endeavour to fell them in \\nhot weather. \\nMETEOROLOGY. \\nOn the loth inb. about twelve o’clock at night* a re- \\nmarkable meteor was obferved by one of the mailers of the \\nFree-fchooJ at Alnwick, and another perfon; it appeared \\nin the fouth-weft, at a confiderable altitude. At firft it was \\nno bigger but far brighter than a common liar, but prefently \\nexpanded into the form and fize of an apothecary’s pedle. \\nIt was then obfcured by a cloud, which was bill illuminated \\nbehind; when the cloud was difpelled, it re-appeared with \\na diredlion fouth and north, with a fmall long dreamer, \\ncutting the pedle a little below the centre, and iffuing away \\nto the eaflward. It was again obfcured, and on its re-ap¬ \\npearance, the dreamer and peflle had formed the figure of a \\nhammer, or a crofs; prefently after the dreamer, which \\nmade the fliaft to the hammer, or balk to the crofs, affumed \\ntwo horns, at the extreme point towards the eab, refembling \\na fork. It was then obfcured a third time, but when the \\ncloud paded over, it was changed into the diape of two half¬ \\nmoons, back to back, having a fhort thick luminous dream' \\nbetween the two backs; it then vanidied totally from their, \\nfight. It is obfervable, that every new appearance became \\nbrighter and brighter, till it became an exceedingly bril¬ \\nliant objedt, ail the other dars in companion appearing to \\n\", '4SJ \\n• be only dim fpecks. The time of obfervation was above fire \\nminutes. \\nThe Decade VJnlofophique contains an account of a fin^u- \\nhur phenomenon which was obferved on the 19th of Auguft \\nlaft, at Caumont, principal town of the diftri£f, at the ex¬ \\ntremity of the department of Calvados.—^ The weather \\nwas fine; a few light clouds fcattered here and there in the \\nfhy. The atniofphere was loaded with vapours, the wind \\nNorth Weft, the barometer at 28 and a fra&ion, and Reau¬ \\nmur’s thermometer at between 18 and 19 degrees, about \\n720 of I: ahr. A circle of white clouds was formed about the \\naltitude of the fun, pafied through its centre, ftretching uni¬ \\nformly to the lame height in a horizontal plane. This cir¬ \\ncle, or beit, in its greateft Dreadth, was nearly the fize of \\nthe fun s femi-diameter. Oil this circle were projedied two \\nparhelia or difks nearly of the fame fize as that of the fun, \\nirom which they were at equal diftances; the one at the \\n-right, the other at the left, at the diftance of about 45 de¬ \\ngrees each from the fun. In each of thefe difks, the part op- \\npolite tothelunwasvery luminous, to theextentof nearly three \\n•parts of their diameter, and prefented prifmatic colours. The \\nreft was nebulous (that part next the fun). At about no \\ndegrees from the fun on each fide, appeared two other difks \\ntraced upon the fame circle at equal diftances. Rut they \\nwere perfectly of the fame whitenefs with the circle, and \\nwere not quite round. A femicircle rofe above the fun, and \\nformed an arch, the cord or bafe of which was a fe&ion of \\nthe great white circle, the centre of which was the fun. \\nThe radius of this femicircle was about 22 degrees, and ter¬ \\nminated on each fide of the fun nearly at half the diftance \\n©f the fun from each of the luminous difks. This femi- \\ncirele uniformly contained a vapour of a clear brown, the \\nextremities of which, without any fliade, ran into the fur¬ \\nrounding atmofphere. This phenomenon continued for \\nnearly an hour. The circle began to fade on the North fide, \\nwhere \\n', \"43$ JDjemg. \\n■where it never had been fo clearly marked out. The lumi¬ \\nnous difk difappeared laft, \\nu Thefe obfervations were made by a great number of \\npeople, as it was market day in the place.

The following circular notice has been \\ndace iffued to the academicians. \\n** Royal Academy, Auguft *©th, 179S* \\n“ SIR, \\ntc The Lords of the Committee of Council having expreffed \\na deiire that the gold and lilver coins of this kingdom fliould \\nhave every improvement which the prefent date- of the arts \\ncan afford, and the Royal Academy having agreed to take \\nthe fame into their confideration, the prefident has accor- \\ndingly ordered a general meeting of the academicians on the \\n20th of September next, at feven o’clock in the evening, to \\nreceive the defigns or models of fuch of the members of the \\nacademy as will then offer; which defigns or models are in¬ \\ntended by the lords of the committee to be prefented for his \\nmajedy’s infpection, previous to their being carried into \\neffect. \\nu The coins intended are as followy \\nGold—A two guinea piece, a guinea, and a half guinea. \\nSilver—Five /hilling piece, half crown ditto, one Hulling, \\nand fix-pence. \\nThe head of his prefent majedy, .the arms of the realm, the \\nlion, the crown, and Britannia. \\nIn forming the defigns or models, it is dedred that at¬ \\ntention be paid to the roundnefs and fimplicity of the coin ; \\nto \\n', 'to the whole or part of the infcription on the (ame, and \\nguard againft the wearing or filing. \\n“John Richards, R. A. Secretary/\" \\nIn confequence of the above notice, a meeting took place \\nat the time appointed, when feveral drawings and models \\nwere produced, which were afterwards forwarded to the \\nLords of the Committee of Council, for his majefty’s in^ \\nMuch ought to be done* If hiftorical fadls are not to be \\nrecorded on our coins, the whole intellect and abilities of \\nthe artifts of Great Britain ought to be concentrated as it \\nwere in one focus to produce the acme of excellence. \\nSURGERY. \\nWe have to announce that a confiderable improvement \\nhas lately been made on - the German key for extracting \\nteeth. Mr. Charles Brown, furgeon, having for fonie time \\npaft turned his attention to the llruCture and mechanical \\npowers of thofe inftruments ufed in the lefier operations of \\nfurgery, it appeared to him, that the German-key molt \\ncommonly in ufe, notvvithftanding the various improvements \\nit has undergone, partly by profeffional men, and partly by \\ninftrument-makers, was not well calculated to extract teeth \\nwith fafety and eafe. Having had great experience in this \\nparticular branch of furgery, he endeavoured, and with fuc- \\ncefs, to remedy the defeats that were hill obvious in the in- \\nftrument. As the one produced by Mr. Brown poffefles in \\nan eminent degree many advantages over all others, we fhall, \\nin a future number, prefent our readers with a defeription \\npf it, which the ingenious inventor has prornifed to furnifh \\nus with, illuftrated with an engraving. In the mean time, \\nfinch of our readers as wifli for a more early knowledge of its \\nftructure, may fee one of them at Mr. Whitford’s, furgeon \\ninftrument-maker, in the.

      "firft mechanical invention of modern times. The parent \n",
      "idea of this new and ftupendous power originated, it is well \n",
      "known, in the fertile mind of the Marquis of Worcefler, in \n",
      "the time of the Charles’s * though Captain Savary feems to \n",
      "have been the firft who actually pointed out to the public its \n",

      "Hercules in the cradle. Newcomen and his aflbciate have \n",
      "the merit of bringing it to maturity, and giving to its energies \n",
      "a valuable direction. The principal improvements that have \n",
      "been added to it for the laft thirty years, it has received from \n",
      "the hand of the juftly celebrated Mr. Watt. From the \n",
      "many fruitlefs attempts which have been made lince the date \n",
      "of Mr. Watt’s patent. Hill further to improve the fleam \n",
      "engine, the public has been led to believe, either that it has \n",
      "already arrived at its highefl flate of perfection, or that its \n",
      "defeats admitted not of remedy. Thefe defeCts, as every \n",
      "one knows, are an imperfeCt vacuum, much friCtion, and a \n",
      "Complicated conftruCtion of parts; liable, without great care \n",
      "and attention, to be frequently out of order. It is to thefe \n",
      "points Mr. Cartwright has immediately, and, we may add, \n",
      "fuccefsfully, directed his attention. His firft objeCt feems \n",
      "to have been to obtain, as nearly as may be, an abfolute \n",

      "% Mr. Cartwright’s Patent Steam Engine. \n",
      "vacuum; which, in confequence of the elaflic vapour that \n",
      "feparates from water injected in the ufual mode of conden- \n",
      "fation, no one in the leafl converfant with the philofophy of \n",
      "the fleam engine need be told is impoffible. The con¬ \n",
      "densation, in Mr. Cartwright’s engine, is performed by the \n",
      "application of cold to the external furface of the veffel con¬ \n",
      "taining the Ream. Mr. Cartwright is not, however, the \n",
      "firft who tried this method; the fame has been attempted by. \n",
      "feveral; but with fo little fuccefs, that one of our firfl \n",
      "engineers in this line has been heard to give it as his opinion, \n",
      "that, were a pipe to be laid acrofs the Thames, the condenfa- \n",
      "tion would not be quick enough to work a fleam engine \n",
      "with its full effect. The manner Mr. Cart-wright manages \n",
      "this bufinefs is by admitting the fleam between two metal \n",
      "cylinders lying one within the other, and having cold water \n",
      "flowing through the inner one, and enclofing the outer one. \n",
      "By thefe means a very thin body of fleam is expofed to the \n",
      "greatefl poffible furface. But this is not all: by means of a \n",
      "valve in the piflon there is a conflant communication at all \n",
      "times between the condenfer and the cylinder, either above \n",
      "or below the piflon, fo that, whether it afcends or defcends, \n",
      "the condenfation is always taking place. \n",
      "To reduce the fridtion of the piflon, which, when frefh \n",
      "packed in the common way, lays a very heavy load upon the \n",
      "engine, Mr. Cartwright makes his folely of metal, and ex- \n",
      "panfive. There is a further advantage in this method, from the \n",
      "faving of time and expence in the packing, and from the piflon \n",
      "fitting more accurately, if poffible, the more it is worked. \n",
      "Mr. Cartwright has been equally attentive in fimplifying \n",
      "all the other parts of the engine; his engine having only \n",
      "two valves, and thofe are as nearly felf-acting as may be. \n",
      "But what will probably be efleemed one of the mofl im¬ \n",
      "portant circumflances attending thefe improvements, is the \n",
      "opportunity they afford of fubflituting ardent fpirit, either \n",
      "wholly or in part, in the place of water, for working the \n",
      "engine.. For, as the fluid with which it is worked is made to \n",

      "the ufing alcohol, after the firft fupply, can be attended with \n",
      "little or no expence. O11 the contrary, the advantage will be \n",
      "great, probably equal to the faving of half the fuel. When, \n",
      "indeed, the engine is applied, as Mr. Cartwright occafionally \n",
      "purpofes, both as a mechanical power and as a Hill at the \n",
      "fame time, the whole fuel will be faved. \n",
      "A farther advantage of this invention is its applicability \n",
      "to purpofes requiring only a fmall power, and for wThich any \n",
      "other engine would be too complicated and expeniive. \n",
      "Plate I. reprefents a feCtion of the different parts of the \n",

      "is condenfed, and from thence paffes through h into the pump \n",

      "Recibido el 8 de junio de 1770. Sr. Lane, boticario, calle Aldergate, al honorable Henry Cavendish, R.S., sobre la solubilidad del hierro en agua simple, por la intervención del aire fijo. Calle Aldergate, 5 de junio de 1769. Señor, leído el 23 de noviembre de 1769.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las diversas impregnaciones de las aguas minerales siempre han sido muy difíciles de explicar; y quienquiera que haya leído los diversos y a menudo contradictorios razonamientos sobre este tema, debe percibir claramente que todavía hay espacio para descubrimientos en esta parte de la historia natural.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usted, señor, con sus relatos sobre el aire fijo, y sobre el agua de Rathbone-place, relatados en el último volumen de las Transacciones Filosóficas, ha obligado al público con muchas luces adicionales sobre esta rama del conocimiento. Y, por su conocida precisión y diligentes investigaciones en la mayoría de las indagaciones filosóficas, el mundo erudito tiene grandes razones para esperar muchas otras mejoras nuevas y útiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Por lo tanto, someto a su juicio los siguientes experimentos; que tienen la intención de demostrar que el hierro es soluble en agua simple, por medio del aire fijo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Por la intervención del aire fijo; y por lo tanto, es muy probable que muchas diferentes fuentes calibeadas mantengan su carga metálica solo por este medio. La disolución del hierro en aguas minerales, especialmente aquellas que pierden fácilmente la propiedad de producir un color púrpura con vegetales astringentes, generalmente se ha atribuido a algún gas volátil o ácido. Sin embargo, la química no descubre ningún solvente ácido para el hierro, sino lo que tiene mayor afinidad con los álcalis; y por medio de los cuales, por lo tanto, este metal será precipitado. Por lo tanto, si alguna agua aparece, con una propiedad alcalina predominante, que también tiene el poder de teñir con agallas, y, al estar expuesta al aire libre, deposita hierro y pierde esa propiedad, ¿no podemos concluir que el metal ha sido suspendido por algún otro medio?\n",
      "\n",
      "Este, por ejemplo, es claramente el caso en el agua de Spa alemán, que el Dr. Brownrigg ha demostrado que abunda en aire fijo. Sus propios experimentos muy curiosos, antes citados, han demostrado claramente que las tierras calcáreas pueden ser suspendidas en agua por este principio de aire fijo. Y estos me han llevado a examinar si el hierro también podría ser disuelto por los mismos medios naturales. Sin embargo, no se me debe suponer que niego que el hierro se encuentra frecuentemente unido con un ácido. La evidencia de esto es suficiente en las piritas y las tierras vitrioladas. Tampoco puedo dudar, pero que estas sustancias contribuyen en gran medida a la impregnación primaria de las aguas, siendo tan fácilmente solubles en ellas; pero como un álcali, o tierra absorbente, a menudo está más que suficientemente presente para saturar el ácido en las aguas minerales, esto desengancharía efectivamente cada partícula.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partícula de hierro difundida por un ácido, a menos que el metal estuviera soportado por algún otro medio. Mis esfuerzos, por lo tanto, para detectar: este solvente, como ahora ruego permiso para presentar ante usted, en el orden en que los hice. Experimento I. Una botella de boca ancha, que contiene medio litro de agua destilada y sesenta granos de limaduras de acero, se suspendió cuarenta y ocho horas sobre algunos destiladores de melaleuca, en fermentación brillante para recibir el aire fijo que escapa del licor fermentado; la superficie de la cual estaba a diez pulgadas debajo de la boca de la botella. Inmediatamente después de su extracción, el agua clara fue decantada de las limaduras y el sedimento ocre. Este licor tenía un sabor a ladrillo y ferruginoso, con un sabor a melaleuca. Una infusión de agallas, o té verde, pronto cambió parte de ella a un color como la tinta. El resto, al estar expuesto al aire libre, rápidamente se volvió turbio, arrojó una película de colores y depositó un sedimento amarillento. El agua ahora retenía muy poco poder de teñir con agallas; y en unos pocos días perdió esta propiedad por completo. Experimento II. Catorce onzas de azúcar grueso, disueltas en siete pintas de agua, se mezclaron con medio litro de levadura, en una botella capaz de contener más del doble de la cantidad anterior. Un extremo de un tubo doblado fue luteado en este recipiente, de modo que no pudiera escapar aire sino a través de él.\n"
