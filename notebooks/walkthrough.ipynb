Hence, if any water appears, with a predominant alkaline power, which also has the ability to tinge with galls, and, on being exposed to the open-air, deposits iron and loses that property, may we not conclude that the metal had been suspended by some other medium?\\nFor instance, this is clearly the case in German Spa water, which Dr. Brownrigg has proven to abound with fixed air.\\nYour own very curious experiments, before cited, have clearly shown that calcareous earths can be suspended in water by this principle of fixed air.\\nAnd these have led me to examine whether iron might not also be dissolved by the same natural means.\\nI would not, however, be supposed to deny that iron is frequently found united with an acid.\\nThe evidence for this is sufficient in pyrites and vitriolic earths.\\nNor can I doubt that these substances largely contribute to the primary impregnation of waters, as they are readily soluble in them; but as an alkaline or absorptive earth is often more than sufficient to saturate the acid in mineral waters, this would effectively disengage every particle.\\nV ol .

      "Sir,\n",

      "The various impregnations of mineral waters have always been very difficult to explain: and whoever has read the diverse and often contradictory reasonings on this subject, must clearly perceive that there is still room for discoveries in this part of natural history.*\n",
      "You, Sir, by your accounts of fixed air, and of Rathbone-place water, related in the last volume of Philosophical Transactions, have obliged the public with many additional lights on this branch of knowledge^ and, from your known accuracy and diligent pursuits in most philosophical inquiries, the learned world has great reason to hope for many other new and useful improvements.*\n",
      "To your judgment therefore, I submit the following experiments; which are intended to show that iron is soluble in simple water, by the intervention of fixed air.\n",

      "By the intervention of fixed air; and thence, it is very probable, many different chalybeate springs sustain their metallic charge by this means only.\n",
      "The dissolution of iron in mineral waters, especially those that readily lose the property of striking a purple colour with asringent vegetables, has usually been attributed to some volatile gas or acid.\n",
      "Chymistry, however, does not discover any acid solvent for iron, but what has greater affinity with alkalies; and therefore, this metal will be precipitated. Hence, if any water appears, with a predominant alkaline power, which also has the ability to tinge with galls, and, on being exposed to the open-air, deposits iron and loses that property, may we not conclude that the metal had been suspended by some other medium?\n",
      "For instance, this is clearly the case in German Spa water, which Dr. Brownrigg has proven to abound with fixed air.\n",
      "Your own very curious experiments, before cited, have clearly shown that calcareous earths can be suspended in water by this principle of fixed air.\n",
      "And these have led me to examine whether iron might not also be dissolved by the same natural means.\n",
      "I would not, however, be supposed to deny that iron is frequently found united with an acid.\n",
      "The evidence for this is sufficient in pyrites and vitriolic earths.\n",
      "Nor can I doubt that these substances largely contribute to the primary impregnation of waters, as they are readily soluble in them; but as an alkaline or absorptive earth is often more than sufficient to saturate the acid in mineral waters, this would effectively disengage every particle.\n",
