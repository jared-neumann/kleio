Hence if any \\nwater appears, with a predominant alkali, which has \\nalso the power of tinging with galls, and, on being \\nexposed to the open-air, lets fall the iron, and loses \\nthat property; may we not conclude the metal to \\nhave been suspended by some other medium?\\nThis, for example, is plainly the case in German \\nSpa water, which Dr. Brownrigg has proved to \\nabound with fixed air. \\nYour own very curious ex\\xad\\nperiments, before cited, have clearly shown, that \\ncalcareous earths may be suspended in water by this \\nprinciple of fixed air. \\nAnd these have led me to \\nexamine, whether iron might not be dissolved by the \\nsame natural means.\\nI would not, however, be supposed, to deny, that \\niron is frequently found united with an acid. \\nThe \\nfact is sufficiently evinced in the pyrites and vi\\xad\\ntriolic earths. \\nNor can I doubt, but that these sub\\xad\\nstances do largely contribute to the primary impreg\\xad\\nnation of waters, they being so readily soluble in \\nthem.

      "Read Nov. 23, 1769. The various impregnations of mineral waters have always been very difficult to explain: and whoever has read the diverse, and often contradictory reasonings upon the subject, must clearly perceive, that there is still room for discoveries in this part of natural history.\n",
      "You, Sir, by your accounts of fixed air, and of Rathbone-place water, related in the last volume of Philosophical Transactions, have obliged the public with many additional lights on this branch of knowledge, and, from your known accuracy, and diligent pursuits in most philosophical inquiries, the learned World has great reason to hope for many other new and useful improvements. \n",
      "To your judgment therefore, I submit the following experiments; which are intended to show, that iron is soluble in simple water, by the intervention of fixed air; and thence, that it is very probable, many different chalybeate springs sustain their metallic charge by this means only.\n",
      "The solution of iron in mineral waters, especially in such as, by exposure, readily lose the property of striking a purple colour with astringent vegetables, has usually been attributed to some subtle gas, or volatile acid. \n",
      "Chemistry, however, does not discover any acid solvent for iron, but what has greater affinity with alkalies; and by means of which, therefore, this metal will be precipitated. Hence if any water appears, with a predominant alkali, which has also the power of tinging with galls, and, on being exposed to the open-air, lets fall the iron, and loses that property; may we not conclude the metal to have been suspended by some other medium?\n",
      "This, for example, is plainly the case in German Spa water, which Dr. Brownrigg has proved to abound with fixed air. \n",
      "Your own very curious experiments, before cited, have clearly shown, that calcareous earths may be suspended in water by this principle of fixed air. \n",
      "And these have led me to examine, whether iron might not be dissolved by the same natural means.\n",
      "I would not, however, be supposed, to deny, that iron is frequently found united with an acid. \n",
      "The fact is sufficiently evinced in the pyrites and vitriolic earths. \n",
      "Nor can I doubt, but that these substances do largely contribute to the primary impregnation of waters, they being so readily soluble in them. But as an alkali, or absorbent earth, is often found more than sufficient to saturate the acid in mineral waters; this would effectually disengage every particle of iron dissolved by an acid, unless the metal was supported by some other menstruum.\n",

      "Recibido el 8 de junio de 1770. Sr. Lane, boticario, calle Aldergate, al honorable Henry Cavendish, R.S., sobre la solubilidad del hierro en agua simple, por la intervención del aire fijo. Calle Aldergate, 5 de junio de 1769. Señor, leído el 23 de noviembre de 1769.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las diversas impregnaciones de las aguas minerales siempre han sido muy difíciles de explicar; y quienquiera que haya leído los diversos y a menudo contradictorios razonamientos sobre este tema, debe percibir claramente que todavía hay espacio para descubrimientos en esta parte de la historia natural.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usted, señor, con sus relatos sobre el aire fijo, y sobre el agua de Rathbone-place, relatados en el último volumen de las Transacciones Filosóficas, ha obligado al público con muchas luces adicionales sobre esta rama del conocimiento. Y, por su conocida precisión y diligentes investigaciones en la mayoría de las indagaciones filosóficas, el mundo erudito tiene grandes razones para esperar muchas otras mejoras nuevas y útiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Por lo tanto, someto a su juicio los siguientes experimentos; que tienen la intención de demostrar que el hierro es soluble en agua simple, por medio del aire fijo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Por la intervención del aire fijo; y por lo tanto, es muy probable que muchas diferentes fuentes calibeadas mantengan su carga metálica solo por este medio. La disolución del hierro en aguas minerales, especialmente aquellas que pierden fácilmente la propiedad de producir un color púrpura con vegetales astringentes, generalmente se ha atribuido a algún gas volátil o ácido. Sin embargo, la química no descubre ningún solvente ácido para el hierro, sino lo que tiene mayor afinidad con los álcalis; y por medio de los cuales, por lo tanto, este metal será precipitado. Por lo tanto, si alguna agua aparece, con una propiedad alcalina predominante, que también tiene el poder de teñir con agallas, y, al estar expuesta al aire libre, deposita hierro y pierde esa propiedad, ¿no podemos concluir que el metal ha sido suspendido por algún otro medio?\n",
      "\n",
      "Este, por ejemplo, es claramente el caso en el agua de Spa alemán, que el Dr. Brownrigg ha demostrado que abunda en aire fijo. Sus propios experimentos muy curiosos, antes citados, han demostrado claramente que las tierras calcáreas pueden ser suspendidas en agua por este principio de aire fijo. Y estos me han llevado a examinar si el hierro también podría ser disuelto por los mismos medios naturales. Sin embargo, no se me debe suponer que niego que el hierro se encuentra frecuentemente unido con un ácido. La evidencia de esto es suficiente en las piritas y las tierras vitrioladas. Tampoco puedo dudar, pero que estas sustancias contribuyen en gran medida a la impregnación primaria de las aguas, siendo tan fácilmente solubles en ellas; pero como un álcali, o tierra absorbente, a menudo está más que suficientemente presente para saturar el ácido en las aguas minerales, esto desengancharía efectivamente cada partícula.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partícula de hierro difundida por un ácido, a menos que el metal estuviera soportado por algún otro medio. Mis esfuerzos, por lo tanto, para detectar: este solvente, como ahora ruego permiso para presentar ante usted, en el orden en que los hice. Experimento I. Una botella de boca ancha, que contiene medio litro de agua destilada y sesenta granos de limaduras de acero, se suspendió cuarenta y ocho horas sobre algunos destiladores de melaleuca, en fermentación brillante para recibir el aire fijo que escapa del licor fermentado; la superficie de la cual estaba a diez pulgadas debajo de la boca de la botella. Inmediatamente después de su extracción, el agua clara fue decantada de las limaduras y el sedimento ocre. Este licor tenía un sabor a ladrillo y ferruginoso, con un sabor a melaleuca. Una infusión de agallas, o té verde, pronto cambió parte de ella a un color como la tinta. El resto, al estar expuesto al aire libre, rápidamente se volvió turbio, arrojó una película de colores y depositó un sedimento amarillento. El agua ahora retenía muy poco poder de teñir con agallas; y en unos pocos días perdió esta propiedad por completo. Experimento II. Catorce onzas de azúcar grueso, disueltas en siete pintas de agua, se mezclaron con medio litro de levadura, en una botella capaz de contener más del doble de la cantidad anterior. Un extremo de un tubo doblado fue luteado en este recipiente, de modo que no pudiera escapar aire sino a través de él.\n"
